              Despite the genetic and clinical data implicating ASXL1 mutations
              in myeloid malignancies, the mechanisms of transformation by
              ASXL1 mutations are not understood. Here, we identify that ASXL1

  abstract  = {The incidence of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) increases with
               age and mortality exceeds 90\% when diagnosed after age 65. Most
               cases arise without any detectable early symptoms and patients
               usually present with the acute complications of bone marrow
               failure1. The onset of such de novo AML cases is typically
               preceded by the accumulation of somatic mutations in
               preleukaemic haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs)
               that undergo clonal expansion2,3. However, recurrent AML
               mutations also accumulate in HSPCs during ageing of healthy
               individuals who do not develop AML, a phenomenon referred to as
               age-related clonal haematopoiesis (ARCH)4--8. Here we use deep
               sequencing to analyse genes that are recurrently mutated in AML
               to distinguish between individuals who have a high risk of
               developing AML and those with benign ARCH. We analysed
               peripheral blood cells from 95 individuals that were obtained on
               average 6.3 years before AML diagnosis (pre-AML group), together
               with 414 unselected age- and gender-matched individuals (control
               group). Pre-AML cases were distinct from controls and had more
               mutations per sample, higher variant allele frequencies,
               indicating greater clonal expansion, and showed enrichment of
               mutations in specific genes. Genetic parameters were used to
               derive a model that accurately predicted AML-free survival; this
               model was validated in an independent cohort of 29 pre-AML cases
               and 262 controls. Because AML is rare, we also developed an AML
               predictive model using a large electronic health record database
               that identified individuals at greater risk. Collectively our
               findings provide proof-of-concept that it is possible to
               discriminate ARCH from pre-AML many years before malignant
               transformation. This could in future enable earlier detection
               and monitoring, and may help to inform intervention.},

              Myeloid Leukemia (AML), other than rare mutations, are still not
              well understood. METHODS: We performed a bioinformatics study of
              the p53 pathway function at the gene expression level on our
              collection of 1153 p53-pathway related genes. Publically
              available Affymetrix data of 607 de-novo AML patients at
              diagnosis were analyzed according to the patients cytogenetic,
              FAB and molecular mutations subtypes. We further investigated the
              functional status of the p53 pathway in cytogenetically normal
              AML (CN-AML) and Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia (APL) patients
              using bioinformatics, Real-Time PCR and immunohistochemistry.
              RESULTS: We revealed significant and differential alterations of
              p53 pathway-related gene expression in most of the AML subtypes.
              We found that p53 pathway-related gene expression was not
              correlated with the accepted grouping of AML subtypes such as by
              cytogenetically-based prognosis, morphological stage or by the
              type of molecular mutation. Our bioinformatic analysis revealed
              that p53 is not functional in CN-AML and APL blasts at inducing
              its most important functional outcomes: cell cycle arrest,
              apoptosis, DNA repair and oxidative stress defense. We revealed
              transcriptional downregulation of important p53
              acetyltransferases in both CN-AML and APL, accompanied by
              increased Mdmx protein expression and inadequate Chk2 protein
              activation. CONCLUSIONS: Our bioinformatic analysis demonstrated
              that p53 pathway is differentially inactivated in different AML
              subtypes. Focused gene and protein analysis of p53 pathway in
              CN-AML and APL patients imply that functional inactivation of p53
              protein can be attributed to its impaired acetylation. Our
              analysis indicates the need in further accurate evaluation of p53
              pathway functioning and regulation in distinct subtypes of AML.},

              have been detected in more than 10\% of individuals $\geq$65
              years. We aimed to examine the prevalence and characteristics of
              CHDMs throughout adult life. We developed a targeted
              re-sequencing assay combining high-throughput with ultra-high
              sensitivity based on single-molecule molecular inversion probes
              (smMIPs). Using smMIPs, we screened more than 100 loci for CHDMs
              in more than 2,000 blood DNA samples from population controls
              between 20 and 69 years of age. Loci screened included 40 regions
              known to drive clonal hematopoiesis when mutated and 64 novel
              candidate loci. We identified 224 somatic mutations throughout
              our cohort, of which 216 were coding mutations in known driver
              genes (DNMT3A, JAK2, GNAS, TET2, and ASXL1), including 196 point
              mutations and 20 indels. Our assay's improved sensitivity allowed
              us to detect mutations with variant allele frequencies as low as
              0.001. CHDMs were identified in more than 20\% of individuals 60
              to 69 years of age and in 3\% of individuals 20 to 29 years of
              age, approximately double the previously reported prevalence
              despite screening a limited set of loci. Our findings support the
              occurrence of clonal hematopoiesis-associated mutations as a
              widespread mechanism linked with aging, suggesting that mosaicism
              as a result of clonal evolution of cells harboring somatic

               recognition of the 3' splice site during pre-mRNA splicing.
               Somatic U2AF1 mutations are present in approximately 10\% of MDS
               patients. Most U2AF1 mutations are recurrent at 2 highly
               conserved hotspots, while non-canonical mutations are rare.
               U2AF1S34 and U2AF1Q157 mutations map within the zinc finger
               domains of the protein, resulting in distinct downstream
               effects. We have previously shown that U2AF1Q157 mutant patients
               have distinct splicing patterns compared to U2AF1WT with a set
               of misspliced targeted genes, including ARID2 and EZH2. In
               contrast, recent work focusing on S34 suggests a distinct subset
               of misspliced genes, including ATG7 (Park SM, Molecular Cell,
               2016). The biological and clinical implications of these 2
               distinct mutations are unknown. We investigated the differences
               between these mutations with respect to clinical outcomes and
               molecular background, including their impact on clonal
               architecture. Methods: We first collected molecular and clinical
               data on a cohort of 1700 patients with myeloid neoplasms (median
               follow up 1.0 year, range 1-5 years), median age was 65 years
               (range, 11-93). Targeted deep sequencing of a panel of
               frequently mutated genes (64) was applied. Our analyses included
               somatic mutational patterns, clonal hierarchy, and mutational
               correlation of the cohort of patients with U2AF1S34 and
               U2AF1Q157 and those without mutations in this gene. U2AF1
               mutations were found in 5\% (78/1700) of patients, all of them
               were missense and in a heterozygous configuration. Results: Both
               mutations were equally distributed in the cohort: U2AF1S34
               (45\%, 35/78), and U2AF1Q157 (46\%, 36/78). Other mutations
               (Q84, E124, E152, and R156) were detected at a lower frequency
               (9\%). We then dissected the clonal hierarchy of both U2AF1
               mutations and found that 44\% (34/77) were ancestral while 56\%
               (43/77) were secondary. In MDS, most U2AF1 mutations (77\%,
               P=.002) were dominant, while subclonal U2AF1 mutations were
               evenly distributed between the subentities. U2AF1S34 or
               U2AF1Q157 were equally likely to be dominant (21\% vs. 27\%;
               ancestral events; P=.09, respectively). Similarly, S34 and Q157
               mutant clones had similar median variant allele frequencies
               (3-52\% vs. 8-64\%). U2AF1 S34 mutant cases had similar OS to
               patients carrying U2AF1Q157 (N=35 vs. N=36; 10 vs. 15 months;
               P=.209; LogR=.65). When we compared the impact of ancestral vs.
               secondary U2AF1S34 and U2AF1Q157 we found that MDS patients
               carrying ancestral U2AF1 mutations had a shorter OS compared to
               MDS patients carrying secondary U2AF1 patients (N=26 vs. N=18;
               13 vs. 34 months; LogR=.04). Of note, ancestral U2AF1S34
               patients had shorter OS compared to ancestral U2AF1Q157 patients
               (13 vs.11; 10 vs.15 months; P=.03; LogR=.86). Given these
               differences, we also investigated the mutational spectrum of
               U2AF1MUT patients. Cross sectional analysis identified that the
               top genes mutated in the U2AF1 mutant cohort were: ASXL1 (26\%),
               BCOR/L1 (15\%), TET2 (13\%), DNMT3A and PHF6 (12\%), ETV6
               (10\%), RUNX1 and STAG2 (9\%), and SETBP1 (8\%). Transcriptional
               factor and DNA-methylation genes were predominantly mutated in
               U2AF1MUT patients (35\% and 24\%, respectively). Exploring the

               co-occurred with BCOR/L1 mutations (P=.007, 24\%), while Q157
               mutations co-occurred with ASXL1 (P=.003, 44\%) irrespective of
               their rank in the clonal hierarchy. When S34 was the dominant
               mutation, secondary mutations included ETV6, BCOR, and CUX1. In
               contrast, when Q157 was the ancestral event, secondary mutations
               included ASXL1 and DNMT3A. Subclonal S34 occurred in the context
               of ancestral RUNX1, BCOR/L1, CUX1 and DNMT3A, while subclonal
               Q157 followed ancestral ASXL1, EZH2, PHF6 and TET2. Conclusion:
               In sum, U2AF1S34 and U2AF1Q157, consistent with their
               differential missplicing consequences, create a distinct
               molecular milieu leading to differences in clinical outcomes.

              The points at which haematopoietic stem cell-derived progenitors
              commit to each of the various lineages remain mostly unknown. We
              have identified a clonogenic common lymphoid progenitor that can
              differentiate into T, B and natural killer cells but not myeloid
              cells. Here we report the prospective identification,
              purification and characterization, using cell-surface markers and
              flow cytometry, of a complementary clonogenic common myeloid
              progenitor that gives rise to all myeloid lineages. Common
              myeloid progenitors give rise to either megakaryocyte/erythrocyte

              specimen homogenisation. AIMS: To characterise the impact of
              different mixing strategies on whole-blood homogeneity. METHODS:
              Manual inversion, mechanical mixing and automatic mixing
              performed by the Sysmex XT-2000i were evaluated. RESULTS:
              Automated mixing by the instrument, or 1 min of mechanical
              mixing, thoroughly homogenised specimens even for tubes that had
              been refrigerated and left undisturbed for 36 h. Manual
              inversions were almost as effective, provided that specimens were
              first allowed to equilibrate to ambient temperatures.
              CONCLUSIONS: Current sport guidelines that mandate at least 15
              min of mechanical mixing are excessive. Except where specimens
              are presented to the instrument manually, mechanical mixing is
              redundant in the context of full blood counts.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The introduction of novel CTCF binding sites in gene
              regulatory regions in the rodent lineage is partly the effect of
              transposable element expansion, particularly in the murine
              lineage. The exact mechanism and functional impact of
              evolutionarily novel CTCF binding sites are not yet fully
              understood. We investigated the impact of novel
              subspecies-specific CTCF binding sites in two Mus genus
              subspecies, Mus musculus domesticus and Mus musculus castaneus,
              that diverged 0.5 million years ago. RESULTS: CTCF binding site
              evolution is influenced by the action of the B2-B4 family of
              transposable elements independently in both lineages, leading to
              the proliferation of novel CTCF binding sites. A subset of
              evolutionarily young sites may harbour transcriptional
              functionality as evidenced by the stability of their binding
              across multiple tissues in M. musculus domesticus (BL6), while
              overall the distance of subspecies-specific CTCF binding to the
              nearest transcription start sites and/or topologically associated
              domains (TADs) is largely similar to musculus-common CTCF sites.
              Remarkably, we discovered a recurrent regulatory architecture
              consisting of a CTCF binding site and an interferon gene that
              appears to have been tandemly duplicated to create a 15-gene
              cluster on chromosome 4, thus forming a novel BL6 specific immune
              locus in which CTCF may play a regulatory role. CONCLUSIONS: Our
              results demonstrate that thousands of CTCF binding sites show
              multiple functional signatures rapidly after incorporation into
              the genome.},

  abstract = {The proto-oncogene KRAS is mutated in a wide array of human
              cancers, most of which are aggressive and respond poorly to
              standard therapies. Although the identification of specific
              oncogenes has led to the development of clinically effective,
              molecularly targeted therapies in some cases, KRAS has remained
              refractory to this approach. A complementary strategy for
              targeting KRAS is to identify gene products that, when inhibited,
              result in cell death only in the presence of an oncogenic allele.
              Here we have used systematic RNA interference to detect synthetic
              lethal partners of oncogenic KRAS and found that the
              non-canonical IkappaB kinase TBK1 was selectively essential in
              cells that contain mutant KRAS. Suppression of TBK1 induced
              apoptosis specifically in human cancer cell lines that depend on
              oncogenic KRAS expression. In these cells, TBK1 activated
              NF-kappaB anti-apoptotic signals involving c-Rel and BCL-XL (also
              known as BCL2L1) that were essential for survival, providing
              mechanistic insights into this synthetic lethal interaction.
              These observations indicate that TBK1 and NF-kappaB signalling
              are essential in KRAS mutant tumours, and establish a general
              approach for the rational identification of co-dependent pathways
              in cancer.},

  abstract = {Cancer results from genetic alterations that disturb the normal
              cooperative behavior of cells. Recent high-throughput genomic
              studies of cancer cells have shown that the mutational landscape
              of cancer is complex and that individual cancers may evolve
              through mutations in as many as 20 different cancer-associated
              genes. We use data published by Sj{\"o}blom et al. (2006) to
              develop a new mathematical model for the somatic evolution of
              colorectal cancers. We employ the Wright-Fisher process for
              exploring the basic parameters of this evolutionary process and
              derive an analytical approximation for the expected waiting time
              to the cancer phenotype. Our results highlight the relative
              importance of selection over both the size of the cell population
              at risk and the mutation rate. The model predicts that the
              observed genetic diversity of cancer genomes can arise under a
              normal mutation rate if the average selective advantage per
              mutation is on the order of 1\%. Increased mutation rates due to
              genetic instability would allow even smaller selective advantages
              during tumorigenesis. The complexity of cancer progression can be
              understood as the result of multiple sequential mutations, each
              of which has a relatively small but positive effect on net cell

              Likewise, SHPTP2 has been implicated in positive signaling from
              platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta (PDGFR). Upon PDGF
              stimulation, SHPTP2 binds to the PDGFR and becomes
              tyrosine-phosphorylated. We have identified tyrosine-542
              (pY542TNI) as the major in vivo site of SHPTP2 tyrosine
              phosphorylation. The pY542TNI sequence conforms to the consensus
              binding site for the SH2 domain of Grb2, which, by association
              with Sos1, couples some growth factor receptors to Ras. Following
              PDGF stimulation, Grb2 binds tyrosine-phosphorylated SHPTP2.
              Moreover, a mutant PDGFR lacking its SHPTP2 binding site displays
              markedly reduced Grb2 binding. These data indicate that
              phosphorylation of SHPTP2 couples Grb2 to PDGFR in vivo,
              providing a mechanism for Ras activation by PDGFR and for
              positive signaling via SHPTP2 and Csw.},

              progeny remain capable of self-renewal, but only HSCs sustain

              ``intermediate-term'' multipotent HSC stage in mice whose clones

              separable from both short-term as well as permanently

              the tumor-suppressive role of TP53, patients harbor both mono-
              and biallelic mutations10. However, the biological and clinical
              implications of TP53 allelic state have not been fully
              investigated in MDS or any other cancer type. We analyzed 3,324
              patients with MDS for TP53 mutations and allelic imbalances and
              delineated two subsets of patients with distinct phenotypes and
              outcomes. One-third of TP53-mutated patients had monoallelic

              but the mechanisms through which ageing confers this risk are
              largely unknown1. The age-related acquisition of somatic
              mutations that lead to clonal expansion in regenerating
              haematopoietic stem cell populations has recently been associated
              with both haematological cancer2-4 and coronary heart
              disease5-this phenomenon is termed clonal haematopoiesis of
              indeterminate potential (CHIP)6. Simultaneous analyses of
              germline and somatic whole-genome sequences provide the
              opportunity to identify root causes of CHIP. Here we analyse
              high-coverage whole-genome sequences from 97,691 participants of
              diverse ancestries in the National Heart, Lung, and Blood
              Institute Trans-omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed) programme,
              and identify 4,229 individuals with CHIP. We identify
              associations with blood cell, lipid and inflammatory traits that
              are specific to different CHIP driver genes. Association of a
              genome-wide set of germline genetic variants enabled the
              identification of three genetic loci associated with CHIP status,
              including one locus at TET2 that was specific to individuals of
              African ancestry. In silico-informed in vitro evaluation of the
              TET2 germline locus enabled the identification of a causal
              variant that disrupts a TET2 distal enhancer, resulting in
              increased self-renewal of haematopoietic stem cells. Overall, we
              observe that germline genetic variation shapes haematopoietic
              stem cell function, leading to CHIP through mechanisms that are
              specific to clonal haematopoiesis as well as shared mechanisms
              that lead to somatic mutations across tissues.},

              development of therapy-related myeloid neoplasms (tMNs). We find
              that mutations are selected differentially based on exposures.
              Mutations in ASXL1 are enriched in current or former smokers,
              whereas cancer therapy with radiation, platinum and topoisomerase
              II inhibitors preferentially selects for mutations in DNA damage

              other clones when exposed to certain therapies. Among cases in
              which CH was previously detected, the CH mutation was present at

              alternative promoter and multiple splice variants have been
              described for the p53 gene. In this study, we show that p53 has a
              gene structure similar to the p73 and p63 genes. The human p53
              gene contains an alternative promoter and transcribes multiple

              normal human tissue in a tissue-dependent manner. We determine
              that the alternative promoter is conserved through evolution from
              Drosophila to man, suggesting that the p53 family gene structure
              plays an essential role in the multiple activities of the p53

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Normal function of the p53 network is lost in most
              cancers, often through p53 mutation. The clinical impact of p53
              mutations in breast cancer remains uncertain, especially where
              p53 isoforms may modify the effects of these p53 mutations.
              METHODS: Expression of p53$\beta$ and p53$\gamma$ isoforms, the
              isoforms identified in normal breast tissue, was detected by
              reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction from a cohort of
              127 primary breast tumours. Expression of p53$\beta$ and
              p53$\gamma$ isoforms was analysed in relation to clinical markers
              and clinical outcomes (5 years) by binary logistic regression,
              Cox proportional hazards regression and Kaplan-Meier survival
              analyses. RESULTS: p53$\beta$ and p53$\gamma$ were not randomly
              expressed in breast cancer. p53$\beta$ was associated with tumour
              oestrogen receptor (ER) expression, and p53$\gamma$ was
              associated with mutation of the p53 gene. The patient group with
              the mutant p53 breast tumour-expressing p53$\gamma$ isoform had
              low cancer recurrence and an overall survival as good as that of
              patients with wild-type p53 breast cancer. Conversely, patients
              expressing only mutant p53, without p53$\gamma$ isoform
              expression, had a particularly poor prognosis. CONCLUSIONS: The
              determination of p53$\gamma$ expression may allow the
              identification, independently of the ER status, of two
              subpopulations of mutant p53 breast cancer patients, one
              expressing p53$\gamma$ with a prognosis as good as the wild-type
              p53 breast cancer patients and a second one not expressing
              p53$\gamma$ with a particularly poor prognosis. The p53$\gamma$
              isoform may provide an explanation of the hitherto inconsistent
              relationship between p53 mutation, treatment response and outcome
              in breast cancer.},

  abstract = {Growth hormone is widely used clinically to promote growth and
              anabolism and for other purposes. Its actions are mediated via
              the growth hormone receptor, both directly by tyrosine kinase
              activation and indirectly by induction of insulin-like growth
              factor 1 (IGF-1). Insensitivity to growth hormone (Laron
              syndrome) can result from mutations in the growth hormone
              receptor and can be treated with IGF-1. This treatment is,
              however, not fully effective owing to the loss of the direct
              actions of growth hormone and altered availability of exogenous
              IGF-1. Excessive activation of the growth hormone receptor by
              circulating growth hormone results in gigantism and acromegaly,
              whereas cell transformation and cancer can occur in response to
              autocrine activation of the receptor. Advances in understanding
              the mechanism of receptor activation have led to a model in which
              the growth hormone receptor exists as a constitutive dimer.
              Binding of the hormone realigns the subunits by rotation and
              closer apposition, resulting in juxtaposition of the catalytic
              domains of the associated tyrosine-protein kinase JAK2 below the
              cell membrane. This change results in activation of JAK2 by
              transphosphorylation, then phosphorylation of receptor tyrosines
              in the cytoplasmic domain, which enables binding of adaptor
              proteins, as well as direct phosphorylation of target proteins.
              This model is discussed in the light of salient information from
              closely related class 1 cytokine receptors, such as the
              erythropoietin, prolactin and thrombopoietin receptors.},

              of receptor-bound JAK2, based on an archetypal cytokine receptor,
              the growth hormone receptor. For this, we used fluorescence
              resonance energy transfer to monitor positioning of the JAK2
              binding motif in the receptor dimer, substitution of the receptor
              extracellular domains with Jun zippers to control the position of
              its transmembrane (TM) helices, atomistic modeling of TM helix
              movements, and docking of the crystal structures of the JAK2
              kinase and its inhibitory pseudokinase domain with an opposing
              kinase-pseudokinase domain pair. Activation of the receptor dimer
              induced a separation of its JAK2 binding motifs, driven by a
              ligand-induced transition from a parallel TM helix pair to a
              left-handed crossover arrangement. This separation leads to
              removal of the pseudokinase domain from the kinase domain of the
              partner JAK2 and pairing of the two kinase domains, facilitating
              trans-activation. This model may well generalize to other class I

              Ser46 by the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK).
              Activity of p38 MAPK is regulated by the p53-inducible
              phosphatase PPM1D, creating a potential feedback loop. Expression
              of oncogenic Ras suppresses PPM1D mRNA induction, leaving p53
              phosphorylated at Ser33 and Ser46 and in an active state.
              Retrovirus-mediated overexpression of PPM1D reduced p53
              phosphorylation at these sites, abrogated Ras-induced apoptosis
              and partially rescued cells from cell-cycle arrest. Inactivation
              of p38 MAPK (the product of Mapk14) in vivo by gene targeting or
              by PPM1D overexpression expedited tumor formation after injection
              of mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) expressing E1A+Ras into nude
              mice. The gene encoding PPM1D (PPM1D, at 17q22/q23) is amplified
              in human breast-tumor cell lines and in approximately 11\% of
              primary breast tumors, most of which harbor wildtype p53. These
              findings suggest that inactivation of the p38 MAPK through PPM1D
              overexpression resulting from PPM1D amplification contributes to
              the development of human cancers by suppressing p53 activation.},

              hematopoiesis, and oncogenic risk is poorly defined at this time.
              To gain insight into this phenomenon, we analyzed a cohort of
              2530 related and unrelated hematologically normal individuals
              (ages 55 to 101 years). We used a sensitive gene-targeted deep
              sequencing approach to gain precision on the exact prevalence of
              driver mutations and the proportions of affected genes.
              Mutational status was correlated with biological parameters. We
              report a higher overall prevalence of driver mutations (13.7\%),
              which occurred mostly (93\%) in DNMT3A or TET2 and were highly
              age-correlated. Mutation in these 2 genes had some distinctive
              effects on end points. TET2 mutations were more age-dependent,
              associated with a modest neutropenic effect (9\%, P = .012),
              demonstrated familial aggregation, and associated with chronic
              obstructive pulmonary disease. Mutations in DNMT3A had no impact
              on blood counts or indices. Mutational burden of both genes
              correlated with X-inactivation skewing but no significant
              association with age-adjusted telomere length reduction was
              documented. The discordance between the high prevalence of
              mutations in these 2 genes and their limited biological impact
              raise the question of the potential role of dysregulated
              epigenetic modifiers in normal aging hematopoiesis, which may
              include support to failing hematopoiesis.},

              survivors. The lack of more effective, less toxic therapies
              results from our limited understanding of medulloblastoma growth.
              Although TP53 is the most commonly altered gene in cancers, it is
              rarely mutated in medulloblastoma. Accumulating evidence,
              however, indicates that TP53 pathways are disrupted in
              medulloblastoma. Wild-type p53-induced phosphatase 1 (WIP1 or
              PPM1D) encodes a negative regulator of p53. WIP1 amplification
              (17q22-q23) and its overexpression have been reported in diverse
              cancer types. We examined primary medulloblastoma specimens and
              cell lines, and detected WIP1 copy gain and amplification

              and isochromosome 17q (i17q), which are among the most common
              cytogenetic lesions in medulloblastoma. WIP1 RNA levels were
              significantly higher in the tumors with 17q gain or i17q.
              Immunoblots confirmed significant WIP1 protein in primary tumors,
              generally higher in those with 17q gain or i17q. Under basal
              growth conditions and in response to the chemotherapeutic agent,
              etoposide, WIP1 antagonized p53-mediated apoptosis in

              has been taken to indicate a stem cell origin for these groups of
              diseases. However, stem cell depletion or selection pressures can
              also produce skewed X inactivation patterns and might increase
              with age. We have therefore used the HUMARA assay to study X
              inactivation patterns of elderly patients with myeloproliferative
              disorders together with an age-matched control group of normal
              elderly women. A clonal pattern (clonal granulocytes and
              polyclonal T cells) was observed in 23.1\% of normal women and

              marker for myeloproliferative disorders or myelodysplastic
              syndromes in elderly women. Thirdly, our data raise the
              possibility that clonal blood cell patterns may precede rather
              than follow mutations which subsequently give rise to
              myelodysplastic or myeloproliferative phenotypes.},

              Src homology-2 domain-containing phosphatase Shp2 (encoded by
              PTPN11) is a bona fide proto-oncogene. Germline mutations in
              PTPN11 cause Noonan and LEOPARD syndromes, whereas somatic PTPN11
              mutations occur in several types of hematologic malignancies,
              most notably juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia and, more rarely,
              in solid tumors. Shp2 also is an essential component in several
              other oncogene signaling pathways. Elucidation of the events
              underlying Shp2-evoked transformation may provide new insights
              into oncogenic mechanisms and novel targets for anti-cancer
              therapy.},

              proteins by sustaining their dynamic distribution in cellular
              membranes. We show that the GDI-like pocket of PDE$\delta$ binds
              and solubilizes farnesylated Ras proteins, thereby enhancing
              their diffusion in the cytoplasm. This mechanism allows more
              effective trapping of depalmitoylated Ras proteins at the Golgi
              and polycationic Ras proteins at the plasma membrane to counter
              the entropic tendency to distribute these proteins over all
              intracellular membranes. Thus, PDE$\delta$ activity augments
              K/Hras signalling by enriching Ras at the plasma membrane;
              conversely, PDE$\delta$ down-modulation randomizes Ras
              distributions to all membranes in the cell and suppresses
              regulated signalling through wild-type Ras and also constitutive
              oncogenic Ras signalling in cancer cells. Our findings link the

  abstract  = {1507Background: CHIP predisposes to a higher risk of developing
               hematological malignancies and cardiac events. Multiple germline
               mutations have been recognized as contributing to CHIP, most
               notably ASXL1, DNMT3A, and TET2. The frequency of CHIP mutations
               in solid tumor malignancies (STM) is unknown. We report the
               frequency and incidence of CHIP mutations in adult patients
               (pts) with STM. Methods: Data from 880 pts with STM who
               underwent next generation sequencing (NGS) at Foundation One
               from 2013-2017 was collected. This excluded two pts with known
               primary hematological malignancies who were removed. A list of
               CHIP mutations using NCCN guidelines as well as numerous
               original research articles was created, and tabulation of
               pathogenic or likely pathogenic mutations (ASXL1, DNMT3A, TET2,
               JAK2, SF3B1, TP53, GNAS, N/KRAS) was performed. To date, only
               the lung, breast, and colorectal cancer pts have been annotated
               (N = 372) since these cancers have an overall higher incidence
               and prevalence in society. Results: Annotation of lung cancer
               pts (155/880), breast (118/880), and colorectal cancer pts
               (99/880) is collected and represents about 40\% of all pts. At
               least one CHIP mutation was present in 44.5\% (69/155) lung
               cancer pts, 32.2\% (38/118) in breast cancer pts, and 7.1\%
               (7/99) in colorectal cancer pts. Most common mutations found
               were TP53 and KRAS at 29.6\% (110/372) and 28.0\% (104/372),
               respectively. Mutations in genes not known to be somatic drivers
               for solid tumor malignancies, particularly SF3B1, DNMT3A, and
               JAK2, were found at very low frequencies 0.8\% (3/372), 0.5\%
               (2/372), and 0.3\% (1/372), respectively. Notably, ASXL1 and
               TET2 mutations were not encountered in any pts. Conclusions: In
               tumor NGS testing, multiple CHIP mutations were noted to be
               present within the cohort of lung, breast, and colorectal
               cancers. There is a need to further understand clinical
               consequences of CHIP mutations incidentally found in pts with
               STM given known clinical implications of CHIP. We will report on
               clinical data (comorbidities), response/non-response to therapy,
               and identify specific molecular patterns of mutations to further

  abstract = {Clonal hematopoiesis (CH) of indeterminate potential (CHIP),
              defined as the presence of a somatic mutation in the peripheral
              blood at a variant allele frequency (VAF) $\geq$2\%, affects at
              least 10\% of individuals older than 65, but low-VAF clones can
              be detected in 95\% of individuals older than 50. CHIP associates
              with a wide range of comorbidities from atherosclerosis to
              pulmonary disease. A growing body of evidence, primarily from
              studies involving Tet2-knockout and stem cell transplant models
              of CH, suggest that dysregulated inflammation contributes to
              clonal expansion and associated comorbidities. Mutant leukocytes
              from animal models contribute to an inflammatory milieu that may
              confer a selective advantage to the clone, thus perpetuating a
              cycle of inflammation and expansion. Although it is unclear
              whether inflammation or expansion sets this cycle in motion, some
              evidence suggests that inflammation from infections or
              pre-existing comorbidities initiates this cycle. The
              pro-inflammatory phenotypes of macrophages from mutant clones and
              their contributions to disease are well characterized in murine
              models, but have not yet been confirmed in humans. Furthermore,
              the roles of other cell types that can carry mutations of CHIP
              are not fully understood. We propose a rationale for further
              investigation of neutrophils, other granulocytes and T, B, and NK
              cells as they may play a role in CHIP-associated comorbidities.
              As the understanding of CH has advanced, potential interventions,
              especially those targeting aberrant inflammation, have been
              proposed. We are hopeful that as studies continue to unravel the
              complex links between CHIP, inflammation, and leukocyte
              dysfunction, CHIP-related comorbidities may be more effectively

              (3.2\%) mutation positives of which 16 (2.5\%) had MPN at

              32 were CALR positive, corresponding to a population prevalence
              of 3.1\% (confidence interval [CI], 2.8-3.3) and 0.16\% (CI,

              positives without MPN presented elevation of $\geq$1 blood cell
              counts; 80 (13\%) even presented blood cell counts in accordance

              that is 3 to 30 times higher compared with less sensitive
              methods. Mutation-positive non-MPNs with elevated blood cell

              leukemia. Refractory cytopenia of childhood (RCC) is the most
              common subtype of pediatric MDS and has overlapping clinical
              features with viral infections and autoimmune disorders.
              Mutations in TET2 gene are found in about 20-25\% of adult MDS
              and are associated with a decrease in 5-hydroxymethylcytosine
              (5-hmC) content. TET2 deregulation and its malignant potential
              were reported in adult but not in pediatric MDS. We evaluated the
              gene expression and the presence of mutations in TET2 gene in 19
              patients with RCC. TET2 expression level was correlated with
              5-hmC amount in DNA and possible regulatory epigenetic
              mechanisms. One out of 19 pediatric patients with RCC was a
              carrier of a TET2 mutation. TET2 expression and 5-hmC levels were

              correlation with microRNA-22 expression was found. These findings
              suggested that TET2 downregulation and low levels of 5-hmC are
              inversely related to miR-22 expression. The existence of a

               CD146 and the PDGFR$\beta$, but lack endothelial and
               haematopoietic markers such as CD34, CD31, vWF (von Willebrand
               factor), the ligand for Ulex europaeus 1 (UEA1) and CD45
               respectively. The proteoglycan NG2 is a pericyte marker
               exclusively associated with the arterial system. Besides its
               expression in smooth muscle cells, smooth muscle actin
               ($\alpha$SMA) is also detected in subsets of pericytes.
               Adventitial cells surround the largest vessels and, opposite to
               pericytes, are not closely associated to endothelial cells.
               Adventitial cells express CD34 and lack $\alpha$SMA and all
               endothelial and haematopoietic cell markers, as for pericytes.
               Altogether, pericytes and adventitial perivascular cells express
               in situ and in culture markers of MSC and display capacities to
               differentiate towards osteogenic, adipogenic and chondrogenic
               cell lineages. Importantly, adventitial cells can differentiate
               into pericyte-like cells under inductive conditions in vitro.
               Altogether, using purified perivascular cells instead of MSC may
               bring higher benefits to regenerative medicine, including the
               possibility, for the first time, to use these cells uncultured.

  abstract = {Mammalian genomes undergo epigenetic modifications, including
              cytosine methylation by DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs). Oxidation
              of 5-methylcytosine by the Ten-eleven translocation (TET) family
              of dioxygenases can lead to demethylation. Although cytosine
              methylation has key roles in several processes such as genomic
              imprinting and X-chromosome inactivation, the functional
              significance of cytosine methylation and demethylation in mouse
              embryogenesis remains to be fully determined. Here we show that
              inactivation of all three Tet genes in mice leads to gastrulation
              phenotypes, including primitive streak patterning defects in
              association with impaired maturation of axial mesoderm and failed
              specification of paraxial mesoderm, mimicking phenotypes in
              embryos with gain-of-function Nodal signalling. Introduction of a
              single mutant allele of Nodal in the Tet mutant background
              partially restored patterning, suggesting that hyperactive Nodal
              signalling contributes to the gastrulation failure of Tet
              mutants. Increased Nodal signalling is probably due to diminished
              expression of the Lefty1 and Lefty2 genes, which encode
              inhibitors of Nodal signalling. Moreover, reduction in Lefty gene
              expression is linked to elevated DNA methylation, as both
              Lefty-Nodal signalling and normal morphogenesis are largely
              restored in Tet-deficient embryos when the Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b
              genes are disrupted. Additionally, a point mutation in Tet that
              specifically abolishes the dioxygenase activity causes similar
              morphological and molecular abnormalities as the null mutation.
              Taken together, our results show that TET-mediated oxidation of
              5-methylcytosine modulates Lefty-Nodal signalling by promoting
              demethylation in opposition to methylation by DNMT3A and DNMT3B.
              These findings reveal a fundamental epigenetic mechanism
              featuring dynamic DNA methylation and demethylation crucial to
              regulation of key signalling pathways in early body plan
              formation.},

  abstract = {We sought to determine the significance of myeloid clonal
              hematopoiesis (CH) in the UK Biobank cohort (n = 502,524, median
              age = 58 years). Utilizing SNP array (n = 486,941) and whole
              exome sequencing data (n = 49,956), we identified 1166
              participants with myeloid CH, defined by myeloid-associated
              mosaic chromosome abnormalities (mCA) and/or likely somatic
              driver mutations in DNMT3A, TET2, ASXL1, JAK2, SRSF2, or PPM1D.
              Myeloid CH increased by 1.1-fold per annum (myeloid mCA, P = 1.57
              $\times$ 10-38; driver mutations, P = 5.89 $\times$ 10-47).
              Genome-wide association analysis identified two distinct signals
              within TERT that predisposed to myeloid CH, plus a weaker signal
              corresponding to the JAK2 46/1 haplotype. Specific subtypes of
              myeloid CH were associated with several blood features and
              clinical phenotypes, including TET2 mutations and chronic
              obstructive pulmonary disease. Smoking history was significantly
              associated with myeloid CH: 53\% of myeloid CH cases were smokers
              compared to 44\% of controls (P = 3.38 $\times$ 10-6), a
              difference principally due to current (OR = 1.10; P = 6.14
              $\times$ 10-6) rather than past smoking (P = 0.08). Breakdown of
              CH by specific mutation type revealed that ASXL1 loss of function
              mutations were most strongly associated with current smoking
              status (OR = 1.07; P = 1.92 $\times$ 10-5), and the only
              abnormality associated with past smoking (OR = 1.04; P = 0.0026).
              We suggest that the inflammatory environment induced by smoking
              may promote the outgrowth of ASXL1-mutant clones.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The myelodysplastic syndromes and myeloproliferative
              disorders are associated with deregulated production of myeloid
              cells. The mechanisms underlying these disorders are not well
              defined. METHODS: We conducted a combination of molecular,
              cytogenetic, comparative-genomic-hybridization, and
              single-nucleotide-polymorphism analyses to identify a candidate
              tumor-suppressor gene common to patients with myelodysplastic
              syndromes, myeloproliferative disorders, and acute myeloid
              leukemia (AML). The coding sequence of this gene, TET2, was
              determined in 320 patients. We analyzed the consequences of
              deletions or mutations in TET2 with the use of in vitro clonal
              assays and transplantation of human tumor cells into mice.
              RESULTS: We initially identified deletions or mutations in TET2
              in three patients with myelodysplastic syndromes, in three of
              five patients with myeloproliferative disorders, in two patients
              with primary AML, and in one patient with secondary AML. We
              selected the six patients with myelodysplastic syndromes or AML
              because they carried acquired rearrangements on chromosome 4q24;
              we selected the five patients with myeloproliferative disorders
              because they carried a dominant clone in hematopoietic progenitor
              cells that was positive for the V617F mutation in the Janus
              kinase 2 (JAK2) gene. TET2 defects were observed in 15 of 81
              patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (19\%), in 24 of 198
              patients with myeloproliferative disorders (12\%) (with or
              without the JAK2 V617F mutation), in 5 of 21 patients with
              secondary AML (24\%), and in 2 of 9 patients with chronic
              myelomonocytic leukemia (22\%). TET2 defects were present in
              hematopoietic stem cells and preceded the JAK2 V617F mutation in
              the five samples from patients with myeloproliferative disorders
              that we analyzed. CONCLUSIONS: Somatic mutations in TET2 occur in
              about 15\% of patients with various myeloid cancers.},

  abstract  = {Several cell types have been proposed to create niches for
               haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). However, the expression
               patterns of HSC maintenance factors have not been systematically
               studied and no such factor has been conditionally deleted from
               any candidate niche cell. Thus, the cellular sources of these
               factors are undetermined. Stem cell factor (SCF; also known as
               KITL) is a key niche component that maintains HSCs. Here, using
               Scfgfp knock-in mice, we found that Scf was primarily expressed
               by perivascular cells throughout the bone marrow. HSC frequency
               and function were not affected when Scf was conditionally
               deleted from haematopoietic cells, osteoblasts, nestin-cre- or
               nestin-creER-expressing cells. However, HSCs were depleted from
               bone marrow when Scf was deleted from endothelial cells or
               leptin receptor (Lepr)-expressing perivascular stromal cells.
               Most HSCs were lost when Scf was deleted from both endothelial
               and Lepr-expressing perivascular cells. Thus, HSCs reside in a
               perivascular niche in which multiple cell types express factors
               that promote HSC maintenance. The cellular sources of stem cell
               factor, a major haematopoietic stem cell (HSC) niche cytokine
               required for HSC maintenance, are identified. The haematopoietic
               niche is a microenvironment that maintains and regulates
               haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Using a systematic conditional
               genetic approach, Sean Morrison and colleagues identify the
               cellular sources of stem cell factor (SCF), a major niche
               cytokine required for maintenance of haematopoietic stem cells.
               They found SCF to be expressed by endothelial cells and leptin
               receptor-expressing perivascular stromal cells, but not by
               previously described niche cells, such as osteoblasts. These
               findings demonstrate that haematopoietic stem cells reside in a
               perivascular niche in which multiple cell types express factors
               that promote their maintenance.},

               cell survival and function},
  author    = {Dutta, Avik and Yang, Yue and Le, Bao and Mohi, Golam},
  abstract  = {Somatic mutations in U2AF1 have been identified in ~11\% cases
               of MDS. U2AF1 is involved in the recognition of the 3' splice
               site required for the recruitment of the U2 snRNP during
               pre-mRNA splicing. Most U2AF1 mutations are found in two
               hotspots (S34 and Q157) within the first and second zinc finger
               domains. Transgenic and knock-in mice expressing U2AF1 S34F
               mutant exhibit impaired hematopoiesis. However, the role of
               wild-type U2AF1 in regulating hematopoietic stem cell (HSC)
               function and normal hematopoiesis has remained unknown. To
               determine the role of U2AF1 in normal hematopoiesis, we
               generated a new conditional U2af1 knockout (floxed) mouse. We
               crossed U2af1 floxed mouse with Mx1-Cre mouse and the expression
               of Cre recombinase was induced with polyinosine-polycytosine
               (pI-pC) injection at 5 to 6 weeks after birth. We observed that
               deletion of U2af1 significantly reduced white blood cell,
               neutrophil, red blood cell and platelet counts in their
               peripheral blood compared with control animals within 10-14 days
               after pI-pC injection. Histopathologic analysis of the BM
               sections from U2af1-deficient mice showed severe BM aplasia.
               Flow cytometric analyses revealed a marked decrease in myeloid,
               erythroid and megakaryocytic precursors in the BM of
               U2af1-deficient mice compared with control animals. We also
               observed a marked decrease in Lin-Sca-1+c-kit+(LSK) and
               long-term hematopoietic stem cells (LT-HSC), short-term HSC
               (ST-HSC), and multipotential progenitors (MPP) as well as common
               myeloid progenitors (CMP), granulocyte-macrophage progenitors
               (GMP), and megakaryocyte-erythroid progenitors (MEP) in the BM
               of U2af1-deleted mice. Hematopoietic progenitor colony assays
               showed a significant decrease in myeloid (CFU-GM), erythroid
               (BFU-E), and megakaryocytic (CFU-Mk) colonies in the BM of
               U2af1-deficient mice.Together, these data suggest that loss of
               U2af1 causes severe defects in hematopoiesis. We performed both
               non-competitive and competitive BM transplantation assays using
               U2af1-deficient BM to determine the role of U2af1 in HSC
               function. There was marked reduction of HSC, progenitors and all
               types of blood and BM cell precursors upon U2af1 deletion (by
               pI-pC administration) in the transplanted animals. Also,
               U2af1-deficient HSCs were unable to compete with WT HSCs and
               there was rapid loss of hematopoietic progenitors/precursors
               derived from the U2af1-deficient HSCs. Since U2af1 deletion
               resulted in rapid decrease of hematopoietic progenitors in the
               BM, we asked whether deletion of U2af1 insulted the genome and
               induced apoptosis to hematopoietic cells in the BM. We observed
               significantly increased apoptosis in the total BM as wells as in
               c-kit+, Gr1+, Ter119+and CD41+cells suggesting that
               hematopoietic progenitors and precursors of multiple cell
               lineages underwent apoptosis upon U2af1 deletion. We also
               performed gamma-H2AX assay using imaging flow cytometry to
               evaluate DNA damage in total BM, Gr1+(myeloid) and
               CD71+(erythroid) cells in control and U2af1-deleted mice. We
               observed markedly elevated gamma-H2AX in total BM, Gr1+and
               CD71+cells from U2af1-deficient mice compared with control
               mice.In addition, we observed increased Chk1 phosphorylation
               (ser345), a hallmark for activation of the ATR pathway, and
               increased histone H2A K119 ubiquitination (H2AK119Ub), a marker
               for DNA damage response, in the BM of U2af1-deficient mice.
               Thus, depletion of U2af1 causes insult to the genome and induces
               DNA damage and increased cell death. To gain insights into
               severe hematopoietic defects observed in U2af1-deficient mice,
               we performed transcriptome profiling of sorted LSK cells from
               U2af1 wild type (control) and U2af1-deleted mice. GSEA analysis
               of RNA sequencing data revealed significant downregulation of
               genes related to HSC maintenance in U2af1-deficient LSK. GSEA
               also revealed enrichment for cell cycle and DNA damage
               response-related genes, consistent with decreased proliferation
               and increased DNA damage and apoptosis observed in
               U2af1-deficient hematopoietic progenitors. We also determined
               the effects of U2af1 deletion on RNA splicing. Interestingly, we
               observed significant changes in gene expression as well as
               splicing alterations in several genes important for HSC survival
               and function. In conclusion, our results suggest a crucial role
               for U2af1 in the survival and function of HSC. Disclosures Mohi:

              clinically silent clonal hematopoiesis (CH) to leukemic
              progression. To investigate the influence of heritable factors on
              CH, we performed deep targeted sequencing of blood DNA from 52
              monozygotic (MZ) and 27 dizygotic (DZ) twin pairs (aged 70-99
              years). Using this highly sensitive approach, we identified CH
              (variant allele frequency $\geq$0.5\%) in 62\% of individuals. We
              did not observe higher concordance for CH within MZ twin pairs as
              compared with that within DZ twin pairs, or to that expected by
              chance. However, we did identify 2 MZ pairs in which both twins
              harbored identical rare somatic mutations, suggesting a shared
              cell of origin. Finally, in 3 MZ twin pairs harboring mutations
              in the same driver genes, serial blood samples taken 4 to 5 years
              apart showed substantial twin-to-twin variability in clonal
              trajectories. Our findings propose that the inherited genome does
              not exert a dominant influence on the behavior of adult CH and
              provide evidence that CH mutations may be acquired in utero.},

              Preferential recognition of specific 3' splice sites in

  abstract = {The Janus protein tyrosine kinases (Jaks) play critical roles in
              transducing growth and differentiation signals emanating from
              ligand-activated cytokine receptor complexes. The activation of
              the Jaks is hypothesized to occur as a consequence of auto- or
              transphosphorylation on tyrosine residues associated with
              ligand-induced aggregation of the receptor chains and the
              associated Jaks. In many kinases, regulation of catalytic
              activity by phosphorylation occurs on residues within the
              activation loop of the kinase domain. Within the Jak2 kinase
              domain, there is a region that has considerable sequence homology
              to the regulatory region of the insulin receptor and contains two
              tyrosines, Y1007 and Y1008, that are potential regulatory sites.
              In the studies presented here, we demonstrate that among a
              variety of sites, Y1007 and Y1008 are sites of trans- or
              autophosphorylation in vivo and in in vitro kinase reactions.
              Mutation of Y1007, or both Y1007 and Y1008, to phenylalanine
              essentially eliminated kinase activity, whereas mutation of Y1008
              to phenylalanine had no detectable effect on kinase activity. The
              mutants were also examined for the ability to reconstitute
              erythropoietin signaling in gamma2 cells, which lack Jak2.
              Consistent with the kinase activity, mutation of Y1007 to
              phenylalanine eliminated the ability to restore signaling.
              Moreover, phosphorylation of a kinase-inactive mutant (K882E) was
              not detected, indicating that Jak2 activation during receptor
              aggregation is dependent on Jak2 and not another
              receptor-associated kinase. The results demonstrate the critical
              role of phosphorylation of Y1007 in Jak2 regulation and function.},

  abstract = {In nuclear pre-messenger RNA splicing, introns are excised by the
              spliceosome, a dynamic machine composed of both proteins and
              small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs). Over thirty years ago, after the
              discovery of self-splicing group II intron RNAs, the snRNAs were
              proposed to catalyse splicing. However, no definitive evidence
              for a role of either RNA or protein in catalysis by the
              spliceosome has been reported so far. By using metal rescue
              strategies in spliceosomes from budding yeast, here we show that
              the U6 snRNA catalyses both of the two splicing reactions by
              positioning divalent metals that stabilize the leaving groups
              during each reaction. Notably, all of the U6 catalytic metal
              ligands we identified correspond to the ligands observed to
              position catalytic, divalent metals in crystal structures of a
              group II intron RNA. These findings indicate that group II
              introns and the spliceosome share common catalytic mechanisms and
              probably common evolutionary origins. Our results demonstrate
              that RNA mediates catalysis within the spliceosome.},

  abstract = {Self-renewal is a defining characteristic of stem cells; however,
              the molecular pathways underlying its regulation are poorly
              understood. Here, we demonstrate that conditional inactivation of
              the Pbx1 proto-oncogene in the hematopoietic compartment results
              in a progressive loss of long-term hematopoietic stem cells
              (LT-HSCs) that is associated with concomitant reduction in their
              quiescence, leading to a defect in the maintenance of
              self-renewal as assessed by serial transplantation.
              Transcriptional profiling revealed that multiple stem cell
              maintenance factors are perturbed in Pbx1-deficient LT-HSCs,
              which prematurely express a large subset of genes, including
              cell-cycle regulators, normally expressed in non-self-renewing
              multipotent progenitors. A significant proportion of
              Pbx1-dependent genes is associated with the TGF-beta pathway,
              which serves a major role in maintaining HSC quiescence.
              Prospectively isolated, Pbx1-deficient LT-HSCs display altered
              transcriptional responses to TGF-beta stimulation in vitro,
              suggesting a possible mechanism through which Pbx1 maintenance of
              stem cell quiescence may in part be achieved.},

  abstract = {We have isolated and analyzed human CTCF cDNA clones and show
              here that the ubiquitously expressed 11-zinc-finger factor CTCF
              is an exceptionally highly conserved protein displaying 93\%
              identity between avian and human amino acid sequences. It binds
              specifically to regulatory sequences in the promoter-proximal
              regions of chicken, mouse, and human c-myc oncogenes. CTCF
              contains two transcription repressor domains transferable to a
              heterologous DNA binding domain. One CTCF binding site, conserved
              in mouse and human c-myc genes, is found immediately downstream
              of the major P2 promoter at a sequence which maps precisely
              within the region of RNA polymerase II pausing and release. Gel
              shift assays of nuclear extracts from mouse and human cells show
              that CTCF is the predominant factor binding to this sequence.
              Mutational analysis of the P2-proximal CTCF binding site and
              transient-cotransfection experiments demonstrate that CTCF is a
              transcriptional repressor of the human c-myc gene. Although there
              is 100\% sequence identity in the DNA binding domains of the
              avian and human CTCF proteins, the regulatory sequences
              recognized by CTCF in chicken and human c-myc promoters are
              clearly diverged. Mutating the contact nucleotides confirms that
              CTCF binding to the human c-myc P2 promoter requires a number of
              unique contact DNA bases that are absent in the chicken c-myc
              CTCF binding site. Moreover, proteolytic-protection assays
              indicate that several more CTCF Zn fingers are involved in
              contacting the human CTCF binding site than the chicken site. Gel
              shift assays utilizing successively deleted Zn finger domains
              indicate that CTCF Zn fingers 2 to 7 are involved in binding to
              the chicken c-myc promoter, while fingers 3 to 11 mediate CTCF
              binding to the human promoter. This flexibility in Zn finger
              usage reveals CTCF to be a unique ``multivalent'' transcriptional
              factor and provides the first feasible explanation of how certain
              homologous genes (i.e., c-myc) of different vertebrate species
              are regulated by the same factor and maintain similar expression
              patterns despite significant promoter sequence divergence.},

              complex array of cellular responses including cell cycle arrest
              and/or apoptosis. IR-induced G1 arrest has been shown to depend
              on the presence of the tumor suppressor p53, which acts as a
              transcriptional activator of several genes. p53 also plays a role
              in the induction of apoptosis in response to DNA damage, and this
              pathway can be activated by both transcription-dependent and
              -independent mechanisms. Here we report the identification of a
              novel transcript whose expression is induced in response to IR in
              a p53-dependent manner, and that shows homology to the type 2C
              protein phosphatases. We have named this novel gene, wip1. In
              vitro, recombinant Wip1 displayed characteristics of a type 2C
              phosphatase, including Mg2+ dependence and relative insensitivity
              to okadaic acid. Studies performed in several cell lines revealed
              that wip1 accumulation following IR correlates with the presence
              of wild-type p53. The accumulation of wip1 mRNA following IR was
              rapid and transient, and the protein was localized to the
              nucleus. Similar to waf1, ectopic expression of wip1 in human
              cells suppressed colony formation. These results suggest that
              Wip1 might contribute to growth inhibitory pathways activated in

  abstract  = {Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is the most commonly diagnosed
               acute leukemia in adults. Despite newly approved treatment, AML
               still results in poor outcomes especially in older patients
               (pts). Cytogenetic abnormalities, gene mutations, and their
               combinations contribute to the pathogenesis and pt outcomes in
               AML. The PTPN11 gene encodes the phosphatase Shp2, which
               activates the RAS-MAPK pathway. Despite the relatively high
               frequency of PTPN11 mutations in AML, little is known about
               associations of PTPN11 mutations with other genomic features and
               their influence on outcomes of pts with standard 7+3
               chemotherapy. In addition, primary resistance to targeted
               therapy, such as venetoclax and enasidenib, has been
               preliminarily noted in PTPN11+ pts. This study sought to
               determine the type and frequency of PTPN11 mutations as well as
               associations with clinical, cytogenetic, and genomic features
               and outcome in adult AML pts treated with 7+3 induction
               chemotherapy followed by consolidation chemotherapy on Cancer
               and Leukemia Group B/Alliance for Clinical Trials in Oncology
               trials. 1,725 newly diagnosed AML pts, defined by the European
               LeukemiaNet 2017 recommendations (excluding acute promyelocytic
               leukemia), were examined using targeted next generation
               sequencing analysis and centrally reviewed metaphase
               cytogenetics. Missense, nonsense, or frameshift variants not
               reported in the 1000 Genomes database, dbSNP137 or dbSNP142,
               were considered mutations. Fisher's exact test was used to
               determine mutation association and complete remission (CR) rates
               while continuous variables are from Wilcoxon rank sum test. The
               median follow-up was 9 years. We identified 140 pts (8.1\%) with
               PTPN11 mutations with the majority (61\%) located in the
               N-terminal SH2 domain (Figure 1). 98 younger ( 0.3. NPM1 (61\%
               vs 31\%, P < .001) and DNMT3A (R882 or other) mutations (39\% vs
               22\%, P < .001) were more likely to co-occur with PTPN11
               mutations than wild-type (WT) PTPN11 (Figure 2). PTPN11
               mutations were less common in FLT3-ITD pts than in those without
               (17\% vs 25\%, P = .07). PTPN11 mutations were more common in
               inv(3)(q21q26)/t(3;3)(q21;q26) pts (26\%, P = .004) and were
               rare in pts with core-binding factor AML, inv(16)/t(16;16) (3\%,
               P = .03) and t(8;21) (0\%, P =.005). Clinical features of
               PTPN11+ pts were similar to those of WT pts except for elevated
               platelet counts (P < .001) and more extramedullary involvement
               (P = .03). For all pts, there was no difference in CR rate,
               disease-free (DFS), overall (OS), and event-free (EFS) survival
               between PTPN11+ and PTPN11- pts. DFS of older PTPN11+ pts was
               shorter (3-y rates: 5\% vs 15\%, P = .04). Given that PTPN11
               mutations often co-occur with NPM1 mutations, which are
               typically associated with favorable outcome (in the absence of a
               high FLT3-ITD ratio), we focused on the contribution of PTPN11
               mutations to outcomes in the NPM1+/FLT3-WT subset. Compared with
               PTPN11-/NPM1+/FLT3-WT, PTPN11+ pts had a lower CR rate (38\% vs
               64\%, P = .001) and shorter EFS (3-y rates: 10\% vs 21\%, P =
               .01), whereas there was no significant differences in OS (3-y
               rates: 23\% vs 32\%, P = .13) or DFS (3-y rates: 27\% vs 33\%, P
               = .75). When considering the role of PTPN11 mutations with WT
               NPM1, there was a reduction in survival in PTPN11+/NPM1- pts
               compared with PTPN11-/NPM1- pts. Younger PTPN11+/NPM1- pts had a
               lower CR rate (45\% vs 71\%, P = .002) and shorter OS (3-y
               rates: 30\% vs 41\%, P = .04), and EFS (3-y rates: 13\% vs 27\%,
               P = .008). Compared to older PTPN11-/NPM1-, older PTPN11+/NPM1-
               pts had a lower CR rate (18\% vs 43\%, P = .04) and shorter DFS
               (3-y rates: 0\% vs 10\%, P = .02) and EFS (3-y rates: 0\% vs
               4\%, P = .02), whereas OS (3-y rates: 12\% vs 10\%, P = .58) had
               no significant difference. To our knowledge, this study is the
               largest cohort of PTPN11+ pts in adult AML and demonstrates
               specific mutational and cytogenetic associations. When
               considering PTPN11+ pts based on NPM1 mutation status, we showed
               that PTPN11 mutations associated with worse outcome in both
               NPM1+ and NPM1- AML pts when treated with intensive
               chemotherapy. Developing targeted treatments to this genomic
               group in AML represents a research priority. Support:

  abstract = {Ageing and age-related diseases share some basic mechanistic
              pillars that largely converge on inflammation. During ageing,
              chronic, sterile, low-grade inflammation - called inflammaging -
              develops, which contributes to the pathogenesis of age-related
              diseases. From an evolutionary perspective, a variety of stimuli
              sustain inflammaging, including pathogens (non-self), endogenous
              cell debris and misplaced molecules (self) and nutrients and gut
              microbiota (quasi-self). A limited number of receptors, whose
              degeneracy allows them to recognize many signals and to activate
              the innate immune responses, sense these stimuli. In this
              situation, metaflammation (the metabolic inflammation
              accompanying metabolic diseases) is thought to be the form of
              chronic inflammation that is driven by nutrient excess or
              overnutrition; metaflammation is characterized by the same
              mechanisms underpinning inflammaging. The gut microbiota has a
              central role in both metaflammation and inflammaging owing to its
              ability to release inflammatory products, contribute to circadian
              rhythms and crosstalk with other organs and systems. We argue
              that chronic diseases are not only the result of ageing and
              inflammaging; these diseases also accelerate the ageing process
              and can be considered a manifestation of accelerated ageing.
              Finally, we propose the use of new biomarkers (DNA methylation,
              glycomics, metabolomics and lipidomics) that are capable of
              assessing biological versus chronological age in metabolic
              diseases.},

  abstract = {Recent advances in DNA sequencing technologies have enhanced our
              knowledge about several diseases. Coupled with easy accessibility
              to blood samples, hematology plays a leading role in
              understanding the process of carcinogenesis. Clonal hematopoiesis
              (CH) with somatic mutations is observed in at least 10\% of
              people over 65 years of age, without apparent hematologic
              disorders. CH is associated with increased risk of hematologic
              malignancies, which is indicative of a pre-malignant condition.
              Therefore, a better understanding of CH will help elucidate the
              mechanism of multi-step tumorigenesis in the hematopoietic
              system. Somatic mutations of ASXL1 are frequently detected in CH
              and myeloid malignancies. Although ASXL1 does not have any
              catalytic activity, it is involved in multiple histone
              modifications including H3K4me3, H3K27me3, and H2AK119Ub,
              suggesting its function as a scaffolding protein. Most ASXL1
              mutations detected in CH and myeloid malignancies are frameshift
              or nonsense mutations of the last exon, generating a C-terminally
              truncated protein. Deletion of Asxl1 or expression of mutant
              ASXL1 in mice alters histone modifications and facilitates
              aberrant gene expression, resulting in myeloid transformation. On
              the contrary, these mice exhibit impaired functioning of
              hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), suggesting the negative effects
              of ASXL1 mutations on stem cell function. Thus, how ASXL1
              mutations induce a clonal advantage of hematopoietic cells and
              subsequent CH development has not been elucidated. Here, we have
              reviewed the current literature that enhances our understanding
              of ASXL1, including its mutational landscape, function, and
              involvement of its mutation in pathogenesis of CH and myeloid
              malignancies. Finally, we discuss the potential causes of CH
              harboring ASXL1 mutations with our latest knowledge.},

  abstract = {Stably acquired mutations in hematopoietic cells represent
              substrates of selection that may lead to clonal hematopoiesis
              (CH), a common state in cancer patients that is associated with a
              heightened risk of leukemia development. Owing to technical and
              sample size limitations, most CH studies have characterized gene
              mutations or mosaic chromosomal alterations (mCAs) individually.
              Here we leverage peripheral blood sequencing data from 32,442
              cancer patients to jointly characterize gene mutations (n =
              14,789) and mCAs (n = 383) in CH. Recurrent composite genotypes
              resembling known genetic interactions in leukemia genomes
              underlie 23\% of all detected autosomal alterations, indicating
              that these selection mechanisms are operative early in clonal
              evolution. CH with composite genotypes defines a patient group at
              high risk of leukemia progression (3-year cumulative incidence
              14.6\%, CI: 7-22\%). Multivariable analysis identifies mCA as an
              independent risk factor for leukemia development (HR = 14, 95\%
              CI: 6-33, P < 0.001). Our results suggest that mCA should be

              presumably occur over many years. Early stages in cancer
              development might be present years before cancers become
              clinically apparent. METHODS: We analyzed data from whole-exome
              sequencing of DNA in peripheral-blood cells from 12,380 persons,
              unselected for cancer or hematologic phenotypes. We identified
              somatic mutations on the basis of unusual allelic fractions. We
              used data from Swedish national patient registers to follow
              health outcomes for 2 to 7 years after DNA sampling. RESULTS:
              Clonal hematopoiesis with somatic mutations was observed in 10\%
              of persons older than 65 years of age but in only 1\% of those
              younger than 50 years of age. Detectable clonal expansions most
              frequently involved somatic mutations in three genes (DNMT3A,
              ASXL1, and TET2) that have previously been implicated in
              hematologic cancers. Clonal hematopoiesis was a strong risk
              factor for subsequent hematologic cancer (hazard ratio, 12.9;
              95\% confidence interval, 5.8 to 28.7). Approximately 42\% of
              hematologic cancers in this cohort arose in persons who had
              clonality at the time of DNA sampling, more than 6 months before
              a first diagnosis of cancer. Analysis of bone marrow-biopsy
              specimens obtained from two patients at the time of diagnosis of
              acute myeloid leukemia revealed that their cancers arose from the
              earlier clones. CONCLUSIONS: Clonal hematopoiesis with somatic
              mutations is readily detected by means of DNA sequencing, is
              increasingly common as people age, and is associated with
              increased risks of hematologic cancer and death. A subset of the
              genes that are mutated in patients with myeloid cancers is
              frequently mutated in apparently healthy persons; these mutations
              may represent characteristic early events in the development of
              hematologic cancers. (Funded by the National Human Genome

              However, considerable between-patient heterogeneity in driver
              mutations complicates evidence-based personalization of cancer
              care. Here, by reanalyzing data from 1,540 patients with acute

  abstract = {Clonal hematopoiesis (CH) describes an asymptomatic expansion of
              blood cells descended from a single hematopoietic stem cell.
              Recent studies have shown that CH increases in frequency with
              aging and is often driven by somatic mutations in genes that are
              recurrently mutated in hematologic malignancies. When CH is
              associated with a mutation in a leukemia-associated gene at a
              variant allele frequency of 0.02 or greater, it is termed
              ``clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential'' (CHIP). CHIP
              has a 0.5\% to 1\% risk per year of progression to hematologic
              neoplasia, and increases both all-cause mortality and the risk of
              myocardial infarction and ischemic stroke due to a
              proinflammatory interaction between clonally derived leukocytes
              and vascular endothelium. CH frequently emerges in the context of
              immune-mediated marrow failure syndromes such as aplastic anemia,
              whereas CH emerging after cytotoxic cancer therapy is strongly
              associated with subsequent development of a therapy-related
              myeloid neoplasm, especially if a TP53 mutation is present.
              However, risk factors for developing CH other than aging, marrow
              failure, and cytotoxic radiotherapy or chemotherapy are poorly
              defined. In this review, we discuss the epidemiology, molecular
              mechanisms, and clinical consequences of this common and

              is essential for pre-mRNA splicing. Because the metazoan BPS is
              short and highly degenerate, this interaction alone is
              insufficient for specific binding of U2 snRNP. The splicing
              factor U2AF binds to the pyrimidine tract at the 3' splice site
              in the earliest spliceosomal complex, E, and is essential for U2
              snRNP binding in the spliceosomal complex A. We show that the U2
              snRNP protein SAP 155 UV cross-links to pre-mRNA on both sides of
              the BPS in the A complex. SAP 155's downstream cross-linking site
              is immediately adjacent to the U2AF binding site, and the two
              proteins interact directly in protein-protein interaction assays.
              Using UV cross-linking, together with functional analyses of
              pre-mRNAs containing duplicated BPSs, we show a direct
              correlation between BPS selection and UV cross-linking of SAP 155
              on both sides of the BPS. Together, our data are consistent with
              a model in which U2AF binds to the pyrimidine tract in the E
              complex and then interacts with SAP 155 to recruit U2 snRNP to

               marrow stromal cell populations shows that distinct niches exist
               in the bone marrow for haematopoietic stem cells and
               lineage-committed progenitors. The chemokine CXCL12 has an
               important role in maintaining haematopoietic stem cell (HSC)
               function. Two complementary papers in the issue of Nature study
               the effects of conditional deletion of Cxcl12 from candidate
               niche cells in the bone marrow and arrive at similar conclusions
               despite using different cre and Cxcl12 alleles. Lei Ding and
               Sean Morrison map CXCL12 expression in different (putative)
               niche components of the adult mouse bone marrow, showing that
               deletion of Cxcl12 from endothelial cells, but not
               Lepr--cre-targeted perivascular stromal cells, contributes to
               HSC maintenance. These niches do not overlap, indicating
               compartmentalization in the bone marrow microenvironment. Daniel
               Link and colleagues deleted Cxcl12 from candidate niche stromal
               cell populations and found that expression of CXCL12 from
               osterix-expressing stromal cells supports B-lymphoid progenitors
               and retains haematopoietic progenitor cells in the bone marrow,
               whereas its expression from stromal cells in the perivascular
               region supports HSCs. These insights into the complexity of the
               HSC niche are of relevance to work on the development of
               haematopoietic disease. Haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs)
               primarily reside in the bone marrow where signals generated by
               stromal cells regulate their self-renewal, proliferation and
               trafficking. Endosteal osteoblasts1,2 and perivascular stromal
               cells including endothelial cells3, CXCL12-abundant reticular
               cells4,5, leptin-receptor-positive stromal cells6, and
               nestin--green fluorescent protein (GFP)-positive mesenchymal
               progenitors7 have all been implicated in HSC maintenance.
               However, it is unclear whether specific haematopoietic
               progenitor cell (HPC) subsets reside in distinct niches defined
               by the surrounding stromal cells and the regulatory molecules
               they produce. CXCL12 (chemokine (C--X--C motif) ligand 12)
               regulates both HSCs and lymphoid progenitors and is expressed by
               all of these stromal cell populations7,8,9,10,11. Here we
               selectively deleted Cxcl12 from candidate niche stromal cell
               populations and characterized the effect on HPCs. Deletion of
               Cxcl12 from mineralizing osteoblasts has no effect on HSCs or
               lymphoid progenitors. Deletion of Cxcl12 from osterix-expressing
               stromal cells, which include CXCL12-abundant reticular cells and
               osteoblasts, results in constitutive HPC mobilization and a loss
               of B-lymphoid progenitors, but HSC function is normal. Cxcl12
               deletion from endothelial cells results in a modest loss of
               long-term repopulating activity. Strikingly, deletion of Cxcl12
               from nestin-negative mesenchymal progenitors using Prx1--cre
               (Prx1 also known as Prrx1) is associated with a marked loss of
               HSCs, long-term repopulating activity, HSC quiescence and common
               lymphoid progenitors. These data suggest that osterix-expressing
               stromal cells comprise a distinct niche that supports B-lymphoid
               progenitors and retains HPCs in the bone marrow, and that
               expression of CXCL12 from stromal cells in the perivascular
               region, including endothelial cells and mesenchymal progenitors,
               supports HSCs.},

              hematopoiesis. In light of recent reports of disparate
              requirements for hematopoietic transcription factors during
              development as opposed to adult hematopoiesis, we used a
              conditional gene-targeting strategy to effect the loss of Runx1
              function in adult mice. In contrast with the critical role of
              Runx1 during development, Runx1 was not essential for
              hematopoiesis in the adult hematopoietic compartment, though a
              number of significant hematopoietic abnormalities were observed.
              Runx1 excision had lineage-specific effects on B- and T-cell
              maturation and pronounced inhibition of common lymphocyte
              progenitor production. Runx1 excision also resulted in
              inefficient platelet production. Of note, Runx1-deficient mice

              of maturing myeloid and erythroid elements. These findings
              indicate that Runx1 deficiency has markedly different
              consequences during development compared with adult
              hematopoiesis, and they provide insight into the phenotypic
              manifestations of Runx1 deficiency in hematopoietic malignancies.},

              whether and how these related oncogenes regulate homeostasis and
              tumorigenesis in the colon. Expression of K-Ras(G12D) in the
              colonic epithelium stimulated hyperproliferation in a
              Mek-dependent manner. N-Ras(G12D) did not alter the growth
              properties of the epithelium, but was able to confer resistance
              to apoptosis. In the context of an Apc-mutant colonic tumor,
              activation of K-Ras led to defects in terminal differentiation
              and expansion of putative stem cells within the tumor epithelium.
              This K-Ras tumor phenotype was associated with attenuated
              signaling through the MAPK pathway, and human colon cancer cells
              expressing mutant K-Ras were hypersensitive to inhibition of Raf,

              differences between mutant Kras and Nras, and suggest that the
              oncogenic phenotype of mutant K-Ras might be mediated by
              noncanonical signaling through Ras effector pathways.},

              patients in CR includes true residual or early recurrent AML,

               altered in CHIP, are nearly universal in individuals by the age
               of 50 but not everyone develops CHIP. This dichotomy suggests
               that environmental factors likely play a major role in CHIP
               emergence. However, the environmental drivers of DNMT3A-mutant
               CHIP have not been determined. Infection has been reported to be
               epidemiologically linked to a variety of cancers, including
               acute myelogenous leukemia. In prior work, we demonstrated that
               systemic chronic infection depletes the hematopoietic stem cell
               (HSC) pool as a result of excessive differentiation. Since prior
               studies showed that Dnmt3a-mutant HSCs demonstrate defective
               differentiation and enhanced self-renewal, we hypothesized that
               infection may provide an environmental selection pressure to
               favor the expansion of Dnmt3a-mutant HSCs over their wild-type

               Mx1-Cre Dnmt3af/f mice, in which Dnmt3a-deletion was induced by
               PIPC treatment, with M. avium. After four weeks of infection, we
               found few differences in the number of HSCs, Ki67+ levels, or
               apoptosis in the blood and bone marrow of WT and Dnmt3a-/- mice.
               However, Dnmt3a-deficient mice became anemic upon M. avium
               infection, suggesting a defect in differentiation. To examine
               the differentiation capacity of DNMT3A-mutant HSCs in response
               to inflammatory stress, we conducted in vitro differentiation
               assays with human CD34+ hematopoietic progenitors. Human CD34+
               cells in which DNMT3A was disrupted by CRISPR gene editing did
               not differentiate normally in response to treatment with
               interferon gamma (IFNy), showing little change in either their
               HSCs or neutrophil numbers after culture with IFNy compared to
               control CD34+ cells. These data demonstrate a striking defect in
               inflammation-induced differentiation in DNMT3A-mutant murine and
               human HSCs. Next, we utilized a mathematical model to predict
               the relative prevalence of different populations of HSCs when
               exposed to the same chronic infectious stress. Specifically, we
               modeled the behavior of a ``minor population'' of Dnmt3a-mutant
               HSCs, compared to a ``major population'' of WT HSCs. This
               modeling exercise demonstrated that impaired HSC differentiation
               in Dnmt3a-mutants during inflammatory stress is sufficient to
               enable the minor Dnmt3a-mutant HSCs to quickly overtake the
               major WT population. To test this prediction, we created mosaic
               mice by transplanting a 1:6 mixture of Dnmt3a-/- and WT
               competitive WBM into lethally irradiated WT mice. Two months
               after transplantation, mosaic mice were systemically infected
               with M. avium, and the infection was allowed to continue for 2
               months prior to examining the bone marrow by flow cytometry. In
               line with the modeling prediction, there was a significant
               expansion of HSCs only among the infected mosaics containing
               Dnmt3a-mutant marrow. Expansion of Dnmt3a-mutant cells was also
               detectible in downstream populations (i.e., multipotent
               progenitors (MPPs)). Dnmt3a-mutant HSCs expansion was similar
               upon infection of mosaics created with Vav-Cre Dnmt3af/f donors,
               where no PIPC-injections are required. To assess the role of
               IFNy signaling in Dnmt3a-mutant clonal expansion, we infected
               mosaic mice containing a 1:6 ratio of Dnmt3a-/- IFNyR1-/- DKO to
               WT HSCs. Strikingly, no clonal expansion was evident among
               infected mosaics with the DKO minor population, indicating a
               requirement for IFNy signaling for Dnmt3a-mutant clonal
               expansion. Next, we conducted RNA-seq to compare the expanded
               Dnmt3a-mutant population versus an unexpanded Dnmt3a-mutant
               population. These data showed that, in stark contrast to WT
               HSCs, the differentiation factor Batf2 was not induced in
               Dnmt3a-mutant HSCs upon M. avium infection. By using Batf2-/-
               mice, we found that Batf2-mutant HSCs are resistant to depletion
               during chronic infection, thus phenocopying Dnmt3a-mutant HSCs
               In summary, we present the first controlled biological
               experiment to demonstrate that an environmental factor -
               infection - can promote Dnmt3a-mutant CHIP. Our studies indicate
               that a defect in differentiation is sufficient to confer a
               survival advantage to Dnmt3a-mutant clones during infectious
               conditions. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to

              Somatic mutations in DNMT3A are drivers of CH, but decades may
              elapse between the acquisition of a mutation and CH, suggesting
              that environmental factors contribute to clonal expansion. We
              tested whether infection provides selective pressure favoring the
              expansion of Dnmt3a mutant hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in
              mouse chimeras. We created Dnmt3a-mosaic mice by transplanting
              Dnmt3a-/- and WT HSCs into WT mice and observed the substantial
              expansion of Dnmt3a-/- HSCs during chronic mycobacterial
              infection. Injection of recombinant IFN$\gamma$ alone was
              sufficient to phenocopy CH by Dnmt3a-/- HSCs upon infection.
              Transcriptional and epigenetic profiling and functional studies
              indicate reduced differentiation associated with widespread
              methylation alterations, and reduced secondary stress-induced
              apoptosis accounts for Dnmt3a-/- clonal expansion during

  abstract  = {Abstract Clonal hematopoiesis (CH) is a condition in which
               individual hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) acquire a fitness
               advantage and contribute disproportionately to peripheral blood
               production. Somatic mutations in around 20 genes are recurrently
               associated with CH, with truncating mutations in PPM1D being
               among the most common. PPM1D encodes the WIP1 protein (Wildtype
               p53-Induced Phosphatase 1), which is upregulated by p53 during
               DNA damage and acts homeostatically to downregulate the DNA
               damage response (DDR). More recently, PPM1D mutations have been
               observed in the blood of individuals who had previously been
               exposed to chemotherapeutic agents for prior malignancies. The
               effect of PPM1D truncating mutations on hematopoiesis remains
               unclear, as does the precise mechanism by which PPM1D mutations
               confer a fitness advantage to hematopoietic stem and progenitor
               cells in CH. To explore the prevalence and features of PPM1D
               mutations in a focused subset of patients with prior
               chemotherapy exposure, we screened for PPM1D mutations in 156
               patients with t-AML (n=77) and t-MDS (n=79) by targeted-capture
               deep sequencing of PPM1D and 295 cancer genes. Truncating
               mutations in PPM1D were detected in 31/156 cases (20\%) with a
               mean VAF of 0.105 (range 0.02-0.48), making it the second most
               commonly mutated gene in t-AML/MDS after TP53 (29\%). In
               contrast, PPM1D mutations were detected in only 0.5\% of a
               matched de novo MDS/AML cohort, confirming a specific enrichment
               in therapy-related cases (Fig 1a). Notably, PPM1D-mutant CH was
               specifically associated with prior exposure to platinum agents
               (p=0.004) and etoposide (p=0.021). To investigate the mechanisms
               behind this clinical association, we created PPM1D truncating
               mutations in multiple cell lines using CRISPR-Cas9. The
               truncated WIP1 protein was highly stabilized, leading to a net
               hyperactive effect on the dephosphorylation of DDR pathway
               members including phospho-p53 and $\gamma$H2AX. We next asked
               whether this translates to chemoresistance, by comparing the
               sensitivities of PPM1D-mutant and wild-type (WT) cells to
               various agents. PPM1D mutants were resistant to DNA-damaging
               agents such as cisplatin, etoposide and doxorubicin, but not to
               vincristine, a microtubule inhibitor, indicating enhanced
               survival in specific contexts. We then asked whether this
               conferred an advantage, by competing PPM1D-mutant and WT cells
               in vitro with multiple exposures. PPM1D mutants did not have an
               advantage at baseline or in the context of vincristine, but
               significantly outcompeted their WT counterparts when exposed to
               cisplatin, etoposide, and doxorubicin. Annexin V staining
               revealed that PPM1D mutants exhibit diminished apoptosis with
               DDR-inducing agents, explaining most of their competitive
               advantage. Co-treatment with a PPM1D inhibitor reversed this
               gain and may have clinical implications. To understand the in
               vivo parameters that impact PPM1D-mutant cell fitness, we next
               generated a novel Ppm1d truncated knock-in mouse model.
               Characterization of baseline hematopoiesis in the Ppm1d mutant
               mouse revealed no appreciable differences in lineage composition
               or proportion of hematopoietic progenitors. To analyze the
               factors that impact clonal evolution, we competed Ppm1d-mutant
               and WT cells in specific proportions in bone marrow
               transplantation. In the context of stress from transplantation
               alone, Ppm1d-mutant and WT HSCs remained at the same proportions
               as the initial transplant. Similarly, serial transplantation did
               not alter their relative contributions to peripheral blood
               production. In contrast, competitively transplanted mice treated
               with cisplatin demonstrated a striking selection for Ppm1d
               mutants in both the peripheral blood (Fig 1b) and LT-HSCs,
               suggesting that Ppm1d-mutant clones achieve greater fitness and
               gain a selective advantage under specific extrinsic stressors.
               This differs from CH-associated mutations in DNMT3A and TET2,
               where intrinsic characteristics such as enhanced self-renewal
               appear sufficient to drive clonal expansion. Broadly, this study
               highlights the significance of context-specificity underlying CH
               of different somatic mutations. Furthermore, these findings
               establish the prognostic significance of CH in the development
               of t-AML/MDS and demonstrate the importance of understanding
               specific treatment mutation interactions to inform choices of
               therapeutic interventions in patients with primary cancers.

  abstract = {Next generation sequencing technologies have provided insights
              into the molecular heterogeneity of various myeloid neoplasms,
              revealing previously unknown somatic genetic events. In our
              cohort of 1444 cases analyzed by next generation sequencing,
              somatic mutations in the gene BRCA1-BRCA2-containing complex 3
              (BRCC3) were identified in 28 cases (1.9\%). BRCC3 is a member of
              the JAMM/MPN+ family of zinc metalloproteases capable of cleaving
              Lys-63 linked polyubiquitin chains, and is implicated in DNA
              repair. The mutations were located throughout its coding region.
              The average variant allelic frequency of BRCC3 mutations was
              30.1\%, and by a serial sample analysis at two different time
              points a BRCC3 mutation was already identified in the initial
              stage of a myelodysplastic syndrome. BRCC3 mutations commonly
              occurred in nonsense (n=12), frameshift (n=4), and splice site
              (n=5) configurations. Due to the marginal male dominance (odds
              ratio; 2.00, 0.84-4.73) of BRCC3 mutations, the majority of
              mutations (n=23; 82\%) were hemizygous. Phenotypically, BRCC3
              mutations were frequently observed in myelodysplastic syndromes
              and myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasms and associated
              with -Y abnormality (odds ratio; 3.70, 1.25-11.0). Clinically,
              BRCC3 mutations were also related to higher age (P=0.01),
              although prognosis was not affected. Knockdown of Brcc3 gene
              expression in murine bone marrow lineage negative, Sca1 positive,
              c-kit positive cells resulted in 2-fold more colony formation and
              modest differentiation defect. Thus, BRCC3 likely plays a role as
              tumor-associated gene in myelodysplastic syndromes and
              myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasms.},

               malignancy are poorly understood. Here we integrated pan-cancer
               splicing analyses with a positive-enrichment CRISPR screen to
               prioritize splicing alterations that promote tumorigenesis. We
               report that diverse SF3B1 mutations converge on repression of
               BRD9, which is a core component of the recently described
               non-canonical BAF chromatin-remodelling complex that also
               contains GLTSCR1 and GLTSCR1L5--7. Mutant SF3B1 recognizes an
               aberrant, deep intronic branchpoint within BRD9 and thereby
               induces the inclusion of a poison exon that is derived from an
               endogenous retroviral element and subsequent degradation of BRD9
               mRNA. Depletion of BRD9 causes the loss of non-canonical BAF at
               CTCF-associated loci and promotes melanomagenesis. BRD9 is a
               potent tumour suppressor in uveal melanoma, such that correcting
               mis-splicing of BRD9 in SF3B1-mutant cells using antisense
               oligonucleotides or CRISPR-directed mutagenesis suppresses
               tumour growth. Our results implicate the disruption of
               non-canonical BAF in the diverse cancer types that carry SF3B1
               mutations and suggest a mechanism-based therapeutic approach for
               treating these malignancies. A range of SF3B1 mutations promote
               tumorigenesis through the repression of BRD9, a core component
               of the non-canonical BAF complex, and correcting BRD9
               mis-splicing in these SF3B1-mutant cells suppresses tumour

              modifications. Although the enzymes that catalyse DNA methylation
              have been characterized, enzymes responsible for demethylation
              have been elusive. A recent study indicates that the human TET1
              protein could catalyse the conversion of 5-methylcytosine (5mC)
              of DNA to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), raising the possibility
              that DNA demethylation may be a Tet1-mediated process. Here we
              extend this study by demonstrating that all three mouse Tet
              proteins (Tet1, Tet2 and Tet3) can also catalyse a similar
              reaction. Tet1 has an important role in mouse embryonic stem (ES)
              cell maintenance through maintaining the expression of Nanog in
              ES cells. Downregulation of Nanog via Tet1 knockdown correlates
              with methylation of the Nanog promoter, supporting a role for
              Tet1 in regulating DNA methylation status. Furthermore, knockdown
              of Tet1 in pre-implantation embryos results in a bias towards
              trophectoderm differentiation. Thus, our studies not only uncover
              the enzymatic activity of the Tet proteins, but also demonstrate
              a role for Tet1 in ES cell maintenance and inner cell mass cell

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The incidence of hematologic cancers increases with
              age. These cancers are associated with recurrent somatic
              mutations in specific genes. We hypothesized that such mutations
              would be detectable in the blood of some persons who are not
              known to have hematologic disorders. METHODS: We analyzed
              whole-exome sequencing data from DNA in the peripheral-blood
              cells of 17,182 persons who were unselected for hematologic
              phenotypes. We looked for somatic mutations by identifying
              previously characterized single-nucleotide variants and small
              insertions or deletions in 160 genes that are recurrently mutated
              in hematologic cancers. The presence of mutations was analyzed
              for an association with hematologic phenotypes, survival, and
              cardiovascular events. RESULTS: Detectable somatic mutations were
              rare in persons younger than 40 years of age but rose appreciably
              in frequency with age. Among persons 70 to 79 years of age, 80 to
              89 years of age, and 90 to 108 years of age, these clonal
              mutations were observed in 9.5\% (219 of 2300 persons), 11.7\%
              (37 of 317), and 18.4\% (19 of 103), respectively. The majority
              of the variants occurred in three genes: DNMT3A, TET2, and ASXL1.
              The presence of a somatic mutation was associated with an
              increase in the risk of hematologic cancer (hazard ratio, 11.1;
              95\% confidence interval [CI], 3.9 to 32.6), an increase in
              all-cause mortality (hazard ratio, 1.4; 95\% CI, 1.1 to 1.8), and
              increases in the risks of incident coronary heart disease (hazard
              ratio, 2.0; 95\% CI, 1.2 to 3.4) and ischemic stroke (hazard
              ratio, 2.6; 95\% CI, 1.4 to 4.8). CONCLUSIONS: Age-related clonal
              hematopoiesis is a common condition that is associated with
              increases in the risk of hematologic cancer and in all-cause
              mortality, with the latter possibly due to an increased risk of
              cardiovascular disease. (Funded by the National Institutes of

              states that precede the development of many hematologic
              malignancies have been difficult to identify. Recent genomic
              studies of blood DNA from tens of thousands of people have
              revealed the presence of remarkably common, age-associated
              somatic mutations in genes associated with hematologic

              single founding cell to a detectable hematopoietic clone. Owing

  abstract  = {The surface immunoglobulin that serves as the B-cell antigen
               receptor (BCR) has two roles in B-cell activation. First, like
               the antigen receptor on T cells, it transmits signals directly
               to the cell's interior when it binds antigen (see Section 6-1).
               Second, the B-cell antigen receptor delivers the antigen to
               intracellular sites where it is degraded and returned to the
               B-cell surface as peptides bound to MHC class II molecules (see
               Chapter 5). The peptide:MHC class II complex can be recognized
               by antigen-specific armed helper T cells, stimulating them to
               make proteins that, in turn, cause the B cell to proliferate and
               its progeny to differentiate into antibody-secreting cells. Some
               microbial antigens can activate B cells directly in the absence
               of T-cell help. The ability of B cells to respond directly to
               these antigens provides a rapid response to many important
               bacterial pathogens. However, somatic hypermutation and
               switching to certain immunoglobulin isotypes depend on the
               interaction of antigen-stimulated B cells with helper T cells
               and other cells in the peripheral lymphoid organs. Antibodies
               induced by microbial antigens alone are therefore less variable
               and less functionally versatile than those induced with T-cell

              remained an enigma long after their discovery by Paul Ehrlich in
              1879. Studies of basophils were hindered by their rarity, by
              difficulties in identifying them, and by the paucity of useful
              analytical tools. Because basophils display several

  abstract = {Normal function of the p53 pathway is ubiquitously lost in
              cancers either through mutation or inactivating interaction with
              viral or cellular proteins. However, it is difficult in clinical
              studies to link p53 mutation status to cancer treatment and
              clinical outcome, suggesting that the p53 pathway is not fully
              understood. We have recently reported that the human p53 gene
              expresses not only 1 but 12 different p53 proteins (isoforms) due
              to alternative splicing, alternative initiation of translation,
              and alternative promoter usage. p53 isoform proteins thus contain
              distinct protein domains. They are expressed in normal human
              tissues but are abnormally expressed in a wide range of cancer
              types. We have recently reported that p53 isoform expression is
              associated with breast cancer prognosis, suggesting that they
              play a role in carcinogenesis. Indeed, the cellular response to
              damages can be switched from cell cycle arrest to apoptosis by
              only manipulating p53 isoform expression. This may provide an
              explanation to the hitherto inconsistent relationship between p53
              mutation, treatment response, and outcome in breast cancer.
              However, the molecular mechanism is still unknown. Recent reports
              suggest that it involves modulation of gene expression in a
              p53-dependent and -independent manner. In this review, we
              summarize our current knowledge about the biological activities
              of p53 isoforms and propose a molecular mechanism conciliating
              our current knowledge on p53 and integrating p63 and p73 isoforms

  abstract = {Hematopoiesis involves a series of lineage differentiation
              programs initiated in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) found in
              bone marrow (BM). To ensure lifelong hematopoiesis, various
              molecular mechanisms are needed to maintain the HSC pool.
              CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) is a DNA-binding, zinc-finger protein
              that regulates the expression of its target gene by organizing
              higher order chromatin structures. Currently, the role of CTCF in
              controlling HSC homeostasis is unknown. Using a
              tamoxifen-inducible CTCF conditional knockout mouse system, we
              aimed to determine whether CTCF regulates the homeostatic
              maintenance of HSCs. In adult mice, acute systemic CTCF ablation
              led to severe BM failure and the rapid shrinkage of multiple
              c-Kithi progenitor populations, including Sca-1+ HSCs. Similarly,
              hematopoietic system-confined CTCF depletion caused an acute loss
              of HSCs and highly increased mortality. Mixed BM chimeras
              reconstituted with supporting BM demonstrated that CTCF
              deficiency-mediated HSC depletion has both cell-extrinsic and
              cell-intrinsic effects. Although c-Kithi myeloid progenitor cell
              populations were severely reduced after ablating Ctcf, c-Kitint
              common lymphoid progenitors and their progenies were less
              affected by the lack of CTCF. Whole-transcriptome microarray and
              cell cycle analyses indicated that CTCF deficiency results in the
              enhanced expression of the cell cycle-promoting program, and that
              CTCF-depleted HSCs express higher levels of reactive oxygen
              species (ROS). Importantly, in vivo treatment with an antioxidant
              partially rescued c-Kithi cell populations and their quiescence.
              Altogether, our results suggest that CTCF is indispensable for
              maintaining adult HSC pools, likely by regulating ROS-dependent
              HSC quiescence.},

              associated with poor survival in patients suffering from
              myelodysplastic syndromes. Here we report the biological function
              of SRSF2 in hematopoiesis by using conditional knockout mouse
              models. Ablation of SRSF2 in the hematopoietic lineage caused
              embryonic lethality, and Srsf2-deficient fetal liver cells showed
              significantly enhanced apoptosis and decreased levels of

              significant changes in alternative splicing. The affected genes
              were enriched in cancer development and apoptosis. These findings
              suggest that intact SRSF2 is essential for the functional

              line missense mutations in PTPN11, encoding the protein-tyrosine

              Ehrlich in 1880 mixed methylene blue with acid fuchsin to produce
              what he termed a ``neutral stain,'' which allowed differentiation
              of blood cells. Eight years later, Ch{\k e}ci{\'n} ski changed
              the acidic component of the dye to eosin. Plehn subsequently
              altered the proportions of eosin and methylene blue to produce a
              greater range of red and blue hues. In 1891, Malachowski and
              Romanowsky independently developed stains composed of eosin and
              ``ripened'' methylene blue that not only differentiated blood
              cells, but also demonstrated the nuclei of malarial parasites. A
              number of ``ripening'' or ``polychroming'' techniques were
              investigated by different groups, but the aqueous dye solutions
              produced were unstable and precipitated rapidly. Subsequently,
              methanol was introduced as a solvent for the dye precipitate and
              techniques were developed that utilized the fixative properties
              of the methanolic solution prior to aqueous dilution for
              staining. This avoided the troublesome process of heat fixation
              of blood films. Giemsa further improved these techniques by using
              more controlled methods of methylene blue demethylation. In
              addition, he used measured amounts of known dyes and increased
              dye stability by adding glycerol to the methanol solvent. With
              the outbreak of World War I, it became difficult to obtain German
              dyes outside of Germany; during the World War II, it became
              impossible. In their effort to improve the inferior American
              versions of Giemsa's stain, Lillie, Roe, and Wilcox discovered
              that the best staining results were obtained using pure methylene
              blue, one of its breakdown products (azure B) and eosin. These

              (NS). Somatic mutations in PTPN11 occur in 35\% of patients with
              de novo, nonsyndromic juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML).
              Myeloproliferative disorders (MPDs), either transient or more
              fulminant forms, can also occur in infants with NS (NS/MPD). We
              identified PTPN11 mutations in blood or bone marrow specimens
              from 77 newly reported patients with JMML (n = 69) or NS/MPD (n =
              8). Together with previous reports, we compared the spectrum of
              PTPN11 mutations in 3 groups: (1) patients with JMML (n = 107);
              (2) patients with NS/MPD (n = 19); and (3) patients with NS (n =
              243). Glu76 was the most commonly affected residue in JMML (n =
              45), with the Glu76Lys alteration (n = 29) being most frequent.
              Eight of 19 patients with NS/MPD carried the Thr73Ile
              substitution. These data suggest that there is a
              genotype/phenotype correlation in the spectrum of PTPN11
              mutations found in patients with JMML, NS/MPD, and NS. This
              supports the need to characterize the spectrum of hematologic
              abnormalities in individuals with NS and to better define the
              impact of the PTPN11 lesion on the disease course in patients
              with NS/MPD and JMML.},

              In the approximately 10 years since the report of Shirakura et al
              in 1978, eating habits have improved and the average life
              expectancy has extended in Japan. Is there any effect of such
              betterment on blood cell counts of the aged? (2) It has been
              pointed out that quality of everyday life, such as staying at
              home but not in an old-age home, working, traveling, and so
              forth, had an influence on the blood cell counts of aged. Is
              there any difference between the blood cell counts of people
              under 60 years and those of people older than 60 years who have a
              good quality of life as mentioned above? The hemoglobin

              count tended to decrease with advancing age. The serum levels of
              TP, TC, and TG also declined with age in those over 60 years of
              age. These results confirmed that the hemoglobin concentration,
              red blood cell count, and hematocrit value decrease in the

  abstract = {Human neutrophils have traditionally been thought to have a short
              half-life in blood; estimates vary from 4 to 18 hours. This dogma
              was recently challenged by stable isotope labeling studies with
              heavy water, which yielded estimates in excess of 3 days. To
              investigate this disparity, we generated new stable isotope
              labeling data in healthy adult subjects using both heavy water (n
              = 4) and deuterium-labeled glucose (n = 9), a compound with more
              rapid labeling kinetics. To interpret results, we developed a
              novel mechanistic model and applied it to previously published (n
              = 5) and newly generated data. We initially constrained the ratio
              of the blood neutrophil pool to the marrow precursor pool (ratio
              = 0.26; from published values). Analysis of heavy water data sets
              yielded turnover rates consistent with a short blood half-life,
              but parameters, particularly marrow transit time, were poorly
              defined. Analysis of glucose-labeling data yielded more precise
              estimates of half-life (0.79 $\pm$ 0.25 days; 19 hours) and
              marrow transit time (5.80 $\pm$ 0.42 days). Substitution of this
              marrow transit time in the heavy water analysis gave a
              better-defined blood half-life of 0.77 $\pm$ 0.14 days (18.5
              hours), close to glucose-derived values. Allowing the ratio of
              blood neutrophils to mitotic neutrophil precursors (R) to vary
              yielded a best-fit value of 0.19. Reanalysis of the previously
              published model and data also revealed the origin of their long
              estimates for neutrophil half-life: an implicit assumption that R
              is very large, which is physiologically untenable. We conclude
              that stable isotope labeling in healthy humans is consistent with
              a blood neutrophil half-life of less than 1 day.},

              the 17q23.2 amplicon and is amplified in ∼8\% of breast cancers.
              The PPM1D gene encodes a serine threonine phosphatase, which is
              involved in the regulation of several tumour suppressor pathways,
              including the p53 pathway. Along with others, we have recently
              shown that PPM1D is one of the drivers of the 17q23.2 amplicon
              and a promising therapeutic target. Here we investigate whether
              PPM1D is overexpressed when amplified in breast cancers and the
              correlations between PPM1D overexpression and amplification with
              clinicopathological features and survival of breast cancer
              patients from a cohort of 245 patients with invasive breast
              cancer treated with therapeutic surgery followed by adjuvant
              anthracycline-based chemotherapy. mRNA was extracted from
              representative sections of tumours containing >50\% of tumour
              cells and subjected to TaqMan quantitative real-time PCR using
              primers for PPM1D and for two housekeeping genes. PPM1D
              overexpression was defined as the top quartile of expression
              levels. Chromogenic in situ hybridization with in-house-generated
              probes for PPM1D was performed. Amplification was defined as
              >50\% of cancer cells with >5 signals per nucleus/large gene
              clusters. PPM1D overexpression and amplification were found in 25
              and 6\% of breast cancers, respectively. All cases harbouring
              PPM1D amplification displayed PPM1D overexpression. PPM1D
              overexpression was inversely correlated with expression of TOP2A,
              EGFR and cytokeratins 5/6 and 17. PPM1D amplification was
              significantly associated with HER2 overexpression, and HER2,
              TOP2A and CCND1 amplification. No association between PPM1D gene
              amplification and PPM1D mRNA overexpression with survival was
              observed. In conclusion, PPM1D is consistently overexpressed when
              amplified; however, PPM1D overexpression is more pervasive than
              gene amplification. PPM1D overexpression and amplification are
              associated with tumours displaying luminal or HER2 phenotypes.
              Co-amplification of PPM1D and HER2/TOP2A and CCND1 are not random
              events and may suggest the presence of a 'firestorm' genetic
              profile.},

               developing a subsequent hematological cancer. We detected clonal
               mosaicism for large chromosomal anomalies (duplications,

               over 50,000 subjects recruited for genome-wide association

               frequency of cells with the same abnormal karyotype (>5--10\%;

  abstract = {Background Biological variation studies have shown that the

              and wide group variation, indicating that the use of reference
              intervals (RIs) is challenging. The aim of this study was to
              examine differences in CBC RIs according to race/ethnicity in a
              multiethnic population at a hospital in San Francisco in hopes of
              improving the medical utility of CBC testing. Methods Subject
              data were obtained by screening CBC results from the medical
              records of outpatients meeting certain criteria who visited
              Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital from April 2017 to
              January 2018. From these records, sex- and
              race/ethnicity-specific CBC RIs were calculated as the 2.5th to
              97.5th percentiles. Results From a total of 552 subjects, 47.9\%
              were male (65 White, 50 Black, 71 Hispanic and 54 Asian) and
              52.1\% were female (51 White, 39 Black, 122 Hispanic and 72

              and hemoglobin, mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular
              hemoglobin (MCH) and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The genetic alterations responsible for an adverse
              outcome in most patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) are
              unknown. METHODS: Using massively parallel DNA sequencing, we
              identified a somatic mutation in DNMT3A, encoding a DNA
              methyltransferase, in the genome of cells from a patient with AML
              with a normal karyotype. We sequenced the exons of DNMT3A in 280
              additional patients with de novo AML to define recurring
              mutations. RESULTS: A total of 62 of 281 patients (22.1\%) had
              mutations in DNMT3A that were predicted to affect translation. We
              identified 18 different missense mutations, the most common of
              which was predicted to affect amino acid R882 (in 37 patients).
              We also identified six frameshift, six nonsense, and three
              splice-site mutations and a 1.5-Mbp deletion encompassing DNMT3A.
              These mutations were highly enriched in the group of patients
              with an intermediate-risk cytogenetic profile (56 of 166
              patients, or 33.7\%) but were absent in all 79 patients with a
              favorable-risk cytogenetic profile (P<0.001 for both
              comparisons). The median overall survival among patients with
              DNMT3A mutations was significantly shorter than that among
              patients without such mutations (12.3 months vs. 41.1 months,
              P<0.001). DNMT3A mutations were associated with adverse outcomes
              among patients with an intermediate-risk cytogenetic profile or
              FLT3 mutations, regardless of age, and were independently
              associated with a poor outcome in Cox proportional-hazards
              analysis. CONCLUSIONS: DNMT3A mutations are highly recurrent in
              patients with de novo AML with an intermediate-risk cytogenetic
              profile and are independently associated with a poor outcome.

  abstract = {Autophosphorylated growth factor receptors provide binding sites
              for the src homology 2 domains of intracellular signaling
              molecules. In response to epidermal growth factor (EGF), the
              activated EGF receptor binds to a complex containing the
              signaling protein GRB2 and the Ras guanine nucleotide-releasing
              factor Sos, leading to activation of the Ras signaling pathway.
              We have investigated whether the platelet-derived growth factor
              (PDGF) receptor binds GRB2-Sos. In contrast with the EGF
              receptor, the GRB2 does not bind to the PDGF receptor directly.
              Instead, PDGF stimulation induces the formation of a complex
              containing GRB2; 70-, 80-, and 110-kDa tyrosine-phosphorylated
              proteins; and the PDGF receptor. Moreover, GRB2 binds directly to
              the 70-kDa protein but not to the PDGF receptor. Using a panel of
              PDGF beta-receptor mutants with altered tyrosine phosphorylation
              sites, we identified Tyr-1009 in the PDGF receptor as required
              for GRB2 binding. Binding is inhibited by a phosphopeptide
              containing a YXNX motif. The protein tyrosine phosphatase
              Syp/PTP1D/SHPTP2/PTP2C is approximately 70 kDa, binds to the PDGF
              receptor via Tyr-1009, and contains several YXNX sequences. We
              found that the 70-kDa protein that binds to the PDGF receptor and
              to GRB2 comigrates with Syp and is recognized by anti-Syp
              antibodies. Furthermore, both GRB2 and Sos coimmunoprecipitate
              with Syp from lysates of PDGF-stimulated cells, and GRB2 binds
              directly to tyrosine-phosphorylated Syp in vitro. These results
              indicate that GRB2 interacts with different growth factor
              receptors by different mechanisms and the cytoplasmic
              phosphotyrosine phosphatase Syp acts as an adapter between the
              PDGF receptor and the GRB2-Sos complex.},

              (17\%) were found to have U2AF1MT, which occurred more common in
              younger patients (P = .001) and represented ancestral lesions in
              a substantial proportion (71\%) of cases. ASXL1MT and isolated +8

              complemented by SC35 but not by SF2/ASF. They can also function
              in a different exonic context from the one used for the selection
              procedure. The selected sequences share one or two close matches
              to a short and highly degenerate octamer consensus, GRYYcSYR. A
              score matrix was generated from the selected sequences according
              to the nucleotide frequency at each position of their best match
              to the consensus motif. The SC35 score matrix, along with our
              previously reported SF2/ASF score matrix, was used to search the
              sequences of two well-characterized splicing substrates derived
              from the mouse immunoglobulin M (IgM) and human immunodeficiency
              virus tat genes. Multiple SC35 high-score motifs, but only two
              widely separated SF2/ASF motifs, were found in the IgM C4 exon,
              which can be spliced in S100 extract complemented by SC35. In
              contrast, multiple high-score motifs for both SF2/ASF and SC35
              were found in a variant of the Tat T3 exon (lacking an
              SC35-specific silencer) whose splicing can be complemented by
              either SF2/ASF or SC35. The motif score matrix can help locate
              SC35-specific enhancers in natural exon sequences.},

              analysed genotyping data from the blood-derived DNA of 482,789
              participants from the UK Biobank10. We identified 19,632

              inherited, rare, large-effect coding or splice variants in 7
              genes that were associated with greatly increased vulnerability
              to clonal haematopoiesis with specific acquired CN-LOH mutations.
              Acquired mutations systematically replaced the inherited risk
              alleles (at MPL) or duplicated them to the homologous chromosome
              (at FH, NBN, MRE11, ATM, SH2B3 and TM2D3). Three of the genes
              (MRE11, NBN and ATM) encode components of the MRN-ATM pathway,
              which limits cell division after DNA damage and telomere

              found that CN-LOH mutations across the genome tended to cause
              chromosomal segments with alleles that promote the expansion of
              haematopoietic cells to replace their homologous (allelic)
              counterparts, increasing polygenic drive for blood-cell
              proliferation traits. Readily acquired mutations that replace

              (ataxia-telangiectasia and Rad3-related) kinases respond to DNA

              DNA repair pathways and cell cycle checkpoints in order to
              maintain genomic integrity. Here we show that the oncogenic
              p53-induced serine/threonine phosphatase, PPM1D (or Wip1),
              dephosphorylates two ATM/ATR targets, Chk1 and p53. PPM1D binds
              Chk1 and dephosphorylates the ATR-targeted phospho-Ser 345,
              leading to decreased Chk1 kinase activity. PPM1D also
              dephosphorylates p53 at phospho-Ser 15. PPM1D dephosphorylations
              are correlated with reduced cellular intra-S and G2/M checkpoint
              activity in response to DNA damage induced by ultraviolet and
              ionizing radiation. Thus, a primary function of PPM1D may be to

              have been identified in gliomas, acute myeloid leukaemias (AML)
              and chondrosarcomas, and share a novel enzymatic property of
              producing 2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG) from $\alpha$-ketoglutarate.
              Here we report that 2HG-producing IDH mutants can prevent the
              histone demethylation that is required for lineage-specific
              progenitor cells to differentiate into terminally differentiated
              cells. In tumour samples from glioma patients, IDH mutations were
              associated with a distinct gene expression profile enriched for
              genes expressed in neural progenitor cells, and this was
              associated with increased histone methylation. To test whether
              the ability of IDH mutants to promote histone methylation
              contributes to a block in cell differentiation in non-transformed
              cells, we tested the effect of neomorphic IDH mutants on
              adipocyte differentiation in vitro. Introduction of either mutant
              IDH or cell-permeable 2HG was associated with repression of the
              inducible expression of lineage-specific differentiation genes
              and a block to differentiation. This correlated with a
              significant increase in repressive histone methylation marks
              without observable changes in promoter DNA methylation. Gliomas
              were found to have elevated levels of similar histone repressive
              marks. Stable transfection of a 2HG-producing mutant IDH into
              immortalized astrocytes resulted in progressive accumulation of
              histone methylation. Of the marks examined, increased H3K9
              methylation reproducibly preceded a rise in DNA methylation as
              cells were passaged in culture. Furthermore, we found that the
              2HG-inhibitable H3K9 demethylase KDM4C was induced during
              adipocyte differentiation, and that RNA-interference suppression
              of KDM4C was sufficient to block differentiation. Together these
              data demonstrate that 2HG can inhibit histone demethylation and
              that inhibition of histone demethylation can be sufficient to
              block the differentiation of non-transformed cells.},

  author   = {Malech, Harry L and Deleo, Frank R and Quinn, Mark T},
  abstract = {Neutrophils, also known as polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs),
              have long been considered as the short-lived, nonspecific white
              cells that form pus-and also happen to kill invading microbes.
              Indeed, neutrophils were often neglected (and largely not
              considered) as immune cells. This historic view of neutrophils
              has changed considerably over the past several decades, and we
              know now that, in addition to playing the predominant role in the
              clearance of bacteria and fungi, they play a major role in
              shaping the host response to infection and immune system
              homeostasis. The change in our view of the role of neutrophils in
              the immune system has been due in large part to the study of
              these cells in vitro. Such work has been made possible by new
              and/or improved methods and approaches used to investigate
              neutrophils. These methods are the focus of this volume.},

              relatively low recurrence risk, this subgroup generates a high
              proportion of relapses. The cause and origin of these relapses
              remains obscure. We therefore explored the mutational landscape
              in high hyperdiploid (HD) ALL with whole-exome (n=19) and
              subsequent targeted deep sequencing of 60 genes in 100 relapsing
              and 51 non-relapsing cases. We identified multiple clones at
              diagnosis that were primarily defined by a variety of mutations
              in receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK)/Ras pathway and
              chromatin-modifying genes. The relapse clones consisted of
              reappearing as well as new mutations, and overall contained more
              mutations. Although RTK/Ras pathway mutations were similarly
              frequent between diagnosis and relapse, both intergenic and
              intragenic heterogeneity was essentially lost at relapse. CREBBP
              mutations, however, increased from initially 18-30\% at relapse,
              then commonly co-occurred with KRAS mutations (P<0.001) and these
              relapses appeared primarily early (P=0.012). Our results confirm
              the exceptional susceptibility of HD ALL to RTK/Ras pathway and
              CREBBP mutations, but, more importantly, suggest that mutant KRAS
              and CREBBP might cooperate and equip cells with the necessary
              capacity to evolve into a relapse-generating clone.},

               mechanisms, including TP53 mutations, TP53 deletions and Murine
               Double Minute 2 (MDM2) overexpression. Downregulation of the
               TP53 pathway likely plays a role in MPN progression as evidenced
               by the association of TP53 loss of heterozygosity with
               transformation to acute leukemia and the presence of
               inactivating mutations of TP53 found in a proportion of
               MPN-blast phase (MPN-BP) cases (Kubesova et al, Leukemia.
               2018;32(2):450-61). Furthermore, MDM2 inhibition induces TP53
               pathway upregulation and consequent targeting of hematopoietic
               stem and progenitor cells in polycythemia vera (PV) and
               myelofibrosis (MF). The MDM2 inhibitor, idasanutlin, has shown
               activity in a Phase I trial of high-risk PV patients
               (Mascarenhas et al. Blood. 2019 Jun 5). An additional regulator
               of TP53 is protein phosphatase, Mg2+/Mn2+ dependent 1D (PPM1D)
               which by dephosphorylating TP53 and stabilizing MDM2 regulates
               the DNA damage response pathway and apoptosis. Somatic
               activating mutations of PPM1D are present in both solid and
               hematologic malignancies and are specifically associated with
               therapy-related myeloid disorders (Hsu et al. Cell Stem Cell.
               2018 Nov 1;23(5):700-13). Grinfeld et al. (N Engl J Med. 2018
               Oct 11;379(15):1416-30) recently reported that in their genomic
               analysis of 2035 MPN patients, PPM1D was the eighth most common
               mutated gene in MPNs at 1.9\% frequency. To determine whether
               there was an association of PPM1D mutations with MPNs we
               analyzed the genomic data of patients who participated in
               several clinical trials executed by the Myeloproliferative
               Neoplasm Research Consortium (MPN-RC). Of 89 MPN-BP patients, 5
               patients harbored a PPM1D mutation with a median variant allele
               frequency (VAF) of 17\%. In comparison, 4 out of 135 high risk
               PV and ET patients harbored a PPM1D mutation with a median VAF
               of 24\%. All mutations were truncating which is consistent with
               previous reports of PPMID mutations in malignancies. The PPM1D
               gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 17 (17q23.2) and
               we hypothesized that cytogenetic aberrations involving this gene
               locus might also contribute to abnormalities of PPM1D function.
               Through analysis of our cytogenetic database, 16/1,124 (1.4\%)
               MPN patients were found to have cytogenomic abnormalities
               involving the region containing the PPM1D gene. Eight of these
               patients had karyotypic abnormalities, including 3 pts with
               isochromosome 17q resulting in a gain of 17q and a loss of 17p,
               including the TP53 gene. The other 4 patients had structural
               variations of 17q which might lead to aberrant expression of
               PPM1D. One patient by FISH analysis had gain of 17q. Ten
               patients had cytogenomic aberrations of 17q detected through
               analysis of array comparative genomic hybridization and single
               nucleotide polymorphism (aCGH+SNP), 2 of which had concurrent
               karyotypic abnormalities of 17q. All patients had a gain or copy
               neutral loss of heterozygosity (cnLOH) of the 17q22-24.2 region.
               CnLOH of this region could lead to aberrant overexpression of
               the PPM1D gene. One of the 8 patients with cnLOH of 17q harbored
               a PPM1D mutation. Of the 16 patients with 17q cytogenomic
               abnormalities, 7 (44\%) had MPN-BP and 7 (44\%) patients had ET
               or ET that progressed to myelofibrosis (MF) or MPN-BP indicating
               an association of these abnormalities with advanced disease. By
               quantitative real time-PCR we determined the PPM1D transcript
               levels in mononuclear cells from 31 MPN patients without known
               PPM1D mutations (7 polycythemia vera (PV), 6 ET, 14 MF, 4
               MPN-BP) and compared the transcript levels to mononuclear cells
               from healthy control patients. Forty-two percent (13/31)
               patients had overexpression of PPM1D (>1.5 fold increase range).
               Fold increase ranged from 1.5-8 and overexpression was present
               in the following diagnoses: 4/7 PV, 1/6 ET, 8/14 MF and 0/4
               MPN-BP. We have provided evidence that a number of abnormalities
               of PPM1D including activating mutations, cytogenetic aberrations
               and transcript overexpression are present in a significant
               proportion of MPN patients. These abnormalities in PPM1D can be
               additional events that lead to the downregulation of TP53 and
               contribute to MPN disease progression. We propose that
               inhibitors of PPM1D may be used in combination with other drugs
               that upregulate TP53 to treat MPN patients. Disclosures Rampal:

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The full complement of DNA mutations that are
              responsible for the pathogenesis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML)
              is not yet known. METHODS: We used massively parallel DNA
              sequencing to obtain a very high level of coverage (approximately
              98\%) of a primary, cytogenetically normal, de novo genome for
              AML with minimal maturation (AML-M1) and a matched normal skin
              genome. RESULTS: We identified 12 acquired (somatic) mutations
              within the coding sequences of genes and 52 somatic point
              mutations in conserved or regulatory portions of the genome. All
              mutations appeared to be heterozygous and present in nearly all
              cells in the tumor sample. Four of the 64 mutations occurred in
              at least 1 additional AML sample in 188 samples that were tested.
              Mutations in NRAS and NPM1 had been identified previously in
              patients with AML, but two other mutations had not been
              identified. One of these mutations, in the IDH1 gene, was present
              in 15 of 187 additional AML genomes tested and was strongly
              associated with normal cytogenetic status; it was present in 13
              of 80 cytogenetically normal samples (16\%). The other was a
              nongenic mutation in a genomic region with regulatory potential
              and conservation in higher mammals; we detected it in one
              additional AML tumor. The AML genome that we sequenced contains
              approximately 750 point mutations, of which only a small fraction
              are likely to be relevant to pathogenesis. CONCLUSIONS: By
              comparing the sequences of tumor and skin genomes of a patient
              with AML-M1, we have identified recurring mutations that may be
              relevant for pathogenesis.},

              14 cancer genes, with tens to hundreds of clones per square
              centimeter. In middle-aged and elderly donors, clones with

              this phenomenon, we interrogated 15 mutation hot spots in blood
              DNA from 4,219 individuals using ultra-deep sequencing. Using
              only the hot spots studied, we identified clonal hemopoiesis in
              0.8\% of individuals under 60, rising to 19.5\% of those $\geq$90

              prevalent than previously realized. DNMT3A-R882 mutations were
              most common and, although their prevalence increased with age,
              were found in individuals as young as 25 years. By contrast,
              mutations affecting spliceosome genes SF3B1 and SRSF2, closely

              change to Pro95His, Pro95Leu, Pro95Arg, Pro95Ala, or Pro95Thr. In

              SRSF2mut was correlated with higher age, less pronounced anemia,
              and normal karyotype. SRSF2mut and EZH2mut were mutually

              inflammatory and immune responses as well as of cell survival.
              They have also been implicated in cellular transformation and
              tumorigenesis. However, despite extensive biochemical
              characterization of NF-kappaB signalling during the past twenty
              years, the requirement for NF-kappaB in tumour development in
              vivo, particularly in solid tumours, is not completely
              understood. Here we show that the NF-kappaB pathway is required
              for the development of tumours in a mouse model of lung
              adenocarcinoma. Concomitant loss of p53 (also known as Trp53) and
              expression of oncogenic Kras(G12D) resulted in NF-kappaB
              activation in primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts. Conversely, in
              lung tumour cell lines expressing Kras(G12D) and lacking p53, p53
              restoration led to NF-kappaB inhibition. Furthermore, the
              inhibition of NF-kappaB signalling induced apoptosis in p53-null
              lung cancer cell lines. Inhibition of the pathway in lung tumours
              in vivo, from the time of tumour initiation or after tumour
              progression, resulted in significantly reduced tumour
              development. Together, these results indicate a critical function
              for NF-kappaB signalling in lung tumour development and, further,
              that this requirement depends on p53 status. These findings also
              provide support for the development of NF-kappaB inhibitory drugs
              as targeted therapies for the treatment of patients with defined
              mutations in Kras and p53.},

              Progenitors were cultured in limiting dilutions with

              rise to at least three lineages (NK cells, B-lineage cells, and

  abstract  = {The purpose of immunology is simple. Cure or prevent disease.
               M1/M2 is useful because it is simple. M1/M2 describes the two
               major and opposing activities of macrophages. M1 activity
               inhibits cell proliferation and causes tissue damage while M2
               activity promotes cell proliferation and tissue repair.
               Remarkably, the molecules primarily responsible for these
               ``Fight'' (NO) or ``Fix'' (Ornithine) activities both arise from
               arginine, and via enzymatic pathways (iNOS and arginase) that
               down regulate each other. The names M1 and M2 were chosen
               because M1 and M2 macrophages promote Th1 and Th2 responses,
               respectively. Products of Th1 and Th2 responses (e.g.,
               IFN-$\gamma$, IL-4) also down regulate M2 and M1activity,
               respectively. Thus, M1/M2 demonstrated the importance of Innate
               Immunity and how it is linked to Adaptive Immunity in a
               beautifully counterbalanced system. ``Civilization'' and
               increased longevity present new disease challenges such as
               cancer and atherosclerosis that do not display classical
               ``foreign'' antigens. And, these diseases are often associated
               with (or caused by) M1- or M2- type responses that were formerly
               useful for fighting infections, but now are inappropriate in our
               increasingly ``germ-free'' societies. In turn, there is
               considerable potential for modulating M1 or M2 Innate responses
               in modern diseases to achieve better health. Finally, since M1
               and Th1 (or M2 and Th2) often work in concert to produce
               characteristic immune responses and disease pathologies, it is
               recommended that Immune Type 1 or 2 (IT1, IT2) would be a
               simpler and unifying terminology going forward.},

  author   = {Miyake, Kensuke and Karasuyama, Hajime},
  abstract = {Basophils have long been neglected in immunological studies
              because they were regarded as only minor relatives of mast cells.
              However, recent advances in analytical tools for basophils have
              clarified the non-redundant roles of basophils in allergic
              inflammation. Basophils play crucial roles in both IgE-dependent
              and -independent allergic inflammation, through their migration
              to the site of inflammation and secretion of various mediators,
              including cytokines, chemokines, and proteases. Basophils are
              known to produce large amounts of IL-4 in response to various
              stimuli. Basophil-derived IL-4 has recently been shown to play
              versatile roles in allergic inflammation by acting on various
              cell types, including macrophages, innate lymphoid cells,
              fibroblasts, and endothelial cells. Basophil-derived serine
              proteases are also crucial for the aggravation of allergic
              inflammation. Moreover, recent reports suggest the roles of
              basophils in modulating adaptive immune responses, particularly

               Gastrulation is defined as an early developmental process in
               which an embryo transforms from a one-dimensional layer of
               epithelial cells (blastula) and reorganizes into a multilayered
               and multidimensional structure called the gastrula. In reptile,
               avians, and mammals, which are triploblastic organisms,
               gastrulation derives a three tissue layered organism composed of
               endoderm, mesoderm, and ectoderm; each germ layer corresponds to
               the development of specific primitive systems during
               organogenesis. In addition to setting the embryo up for organ
               formation, gastrulation provides a mechanism to develop a
               multileveled body plan that demarcates anatomical axis formation
               with dorsal/ventral and cranial/caudal axis (also termed
               anterior or rostral/posterior, respectively), retention of
               global left/right symmetry, and the loss of bilateral symmetry

              Inferred amino acid sequences from these taxa display a high

              haematopoietic stem cell characteristics of pluripotentiality and
              the ability for self-renewal have emerged as characteristics of
              several haematopoietic stem cell populations, including those
              that have recently challenged the conventional concepts of the
              haematopoietic hierarchy. Human allogeneic stem cell therapy
              relies on these functional characteristics of haematopoietic stem
              cells that can be isolated from peripheral blood, bone marrow or
              cord blood, with the additional requirement that immunological
              barriers need to be overcome to allow sustained engraftment while
              minimising risk of graft-versus-host disease developing in the
              recipient of transplanted stem cells. Current and future research
              will continue to focus on the identification of haematopoietic
              stem cell regulators and methods for in vitro and in vivo stem
              cell manipulation, including genome editing, to expand the scope,

  title     = {The First Philosophers of Greece},
  abstract  = {THE histories which we possess and to which we readily turn for
               information concerning the early science of the ancients have
               been prepared mainly by two kinds of writers, having in view two
               different objects. We have on the one hand, works like those of
               Delambre, or in later times of Mr. Narrien, authors possessing a
               comprehensive knowledge of mathematical analysis, and who,
               writing for the benefit of physicists, are most interested in
               exhibiting the scientific connection existing between the older
               philosophers and modern science. As an example of the other
               kind, we may refer to such works as that by Sir G. C. Lewis,
               whose classical attainments were probably in advance of his
               knowledge of physics, and who looked upon the writings of the
               ancients from the point of view of a student of ethics and
               philosophy. He addressed a wider and less specially educated
               class, whose interest in his book was perhaps more literary than
               scientific. Neither method of exhibiting the extent of ancient
               knowledge is free from objection. In either case the original is
               liable to be coloured or distorted by the views of the
               commentator. The modern serious student desires to consult
               original authorities, and takes but little interest in
               compilations, however thorough, by authorities, however
               competent. The work of Mr. Fairbanks will therefore be welcome
               to that class of students, who are anxious to know what the
               various authors have said themselves, not merely the
               interpretation which later writers have put upon these
               utterances. These original sources of information are too often
               only to be found in short fragments scattered liberally
               throughout Greek literature in the form of quotations from the
               earliest writers, or more or less complete epitomes of the
               masters' teaching, prepared by later writers. German criticism
               has been busy with these fragments, determining the relation of
               these writers to each other as well as to the source of the
               whole series, in order that we may estimate their relative
               value. The Greek text of these fragments has been published in
               numerous short monographs, most of which, however, are not
               easily accessible, and a competent guide is necessary. This
               essential service Mr. Fairbanks has rendered to the student by
               placing the materials ready to his hands. He has, moreover,
               prepared a carefully constructed text, enriched it by critical
               notes, and added an English translation. Important passages from
               Plato and Aristotle bearing on these early writers are also
               given, so that even the better known authorities gain some
               illumination. Mr. Fairbanks puts before us all the material for
               the survey of the history of early Greek thought; we necessarily

  author   = {Oren, M},
  abstract = {The p53 tumor-suppressor plays a critical role in the prevention
              of human cancer. In the absence of cellular stress, the p53
              protein is maintained at low steady-state levels and exerts very
              little, if any, effect on cell fate. However, in response to
              various types of stress, p53 becomes activated; this is reflected
              in elevated protein levels, as well as augmented biochemical
              capabilities. As a consequence of p53 activation, cells can
              undergo marked phenotypic changes, ranging from increased DNA
              repair to senescence and apoptosis. This review deals with the
              mechanisms that underlie the apoptotic activities of p53, as well
              as the complex interactions between p53 and central regulatory
              signaling networks. In p53-mediated apoptosis, the major role is
              played by the ability of p53 to transactivate specific target
              genes. The choice of particular subsets of target genes, dictated
              by covalent p53 modifications and protein-protein interactions,
              can make the difference between life and apoptotic death of a
              cell. In addition, transcriptional repression of antiapoptotic
              genes, as well as transcription-independent activities of p53,
              can also contribute to the apoptotic effects of p53. Regarding
              the crosstalk between p53 and signaling networks, this review
              focuses on the interplay between p53 and two pivotal regulatory
              proteins: beta-catenin and Akt/PKB. Both proteins can regulate
              p53 as well as be regulated by it. In addition, p53 interacts
              with the GSK-3beta kinase, which serves as a link between Akt and
              beta-catenin. This review discusses how the functional balance
              between these different interactions might dictate the likelihood
              of a given cell to become cancerous or be eliminated from the
              replicative pool, resulting in suppression of cancer.},

              mutations, and their properties are thought to reflect the sum of
              these mutations. However, little is known about the effect of the
              order in which mutations are acquired. METHODS: We determined
              mutation order in patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms by
              genotyping hematopoietic colonies or by means of next-generation
              sequencing. Stem cells and progenitor cells were isolated to
              study the effect of mutation order on mature and immature
              hematopoietic cells. RESULTS: The age at which a patient
              presented with a myeloproliferative neoplasm, acquisition of JAK2
              V617F homozygosity, and the balance of immature progenitors were
              all influenced by mutation order. As compared with patients in
              whom the TET2 mutation was acquired first (hereafter referred to
              as ``TET2-first patients''), patients in whom the Janus kinase 2
              (JAK2) mutation was acquired first (``JAK2-first patients'') had
              a greater likelihood of presenting with polycythemia vera than
              with essential thrombocythemia, an increased risk of thrombosis,
              and an increased sensitivity of JAK2-mutant progenitors to
              ruxolitinib in vitro. Mutation order influenced the proliferative
              response to JAK2 V617F and the capacity of double-mutant
              hematopoietic cells and progenitor cells to generate
              colony-forming cells. Moreover, the hematopoietic
              stem-and-progenitor-cell compartment was dominated by TET2
              single-mutant cells in TET2-first patients but by JAK2-TET2
              double-mutant cells in JAK2-first patients. Prior mutation of
              TET2 altered the transcriptional consequences of JAK2 V617F in a
              cell-intrinsic manner and prevented JAK2 V617F from up-regulating
              genes associated with proliferation. CONCLUSIONS: The order in
              which JAK2 and TET2 mutations were acquired influenced clinical
              features, the response to targeted therapy, the biology of stem
              and progenitor cells, and clonal evolution in patients with

              numerous relapse-associated mutated genes intertwined in

              One of the affected factors, U2AF1, is involved in splice site
              selection, and the most common change, S34F, alters a conserved
              nucleic acid-binding domain, recognition of the 3' splice site,
              and alternative splicing of many mRNAs. However, the role that
              this mutation plays in oncogenesis is still unknown. Here, we

              5-methylcytosine oxidation. Although TET2 mutations frequently
              occur in various types of haematological malignancies, the
              mechanism by which they increase risk for these cancers remains
              poorly understood. Here we show that Tet2-/- mice develop
              spontaneous myeloid, T- and B-cell malignancies after long
              latencies. Exome sequencing of Tet2-/- tumours reveals
              accumulation of numerous mutations, including Apc, Nf1, Flt3,
              Cbl, Notch1 and Mll2, which are recurrently deleted/mutated in

              strategies. METHODS: We used massively parallel sequencing
              technology to identify somatically acquired point mutations
              across all protein-coding exons in the genome in 9 patients with
              low-grade myelodysplasia. Targeted resequencing of the gene
              encoding RNA splicing factor 3B, subunit 1 (SF3B1), was also
              performed in a cohort of 2087 patients with myeloid or other
              cancers. RESULTS: We identified 64 point mutations in the 9
              patients. Recurrent somatically acquired mutations were
              identified in SF3B1. Follow-up revealed SF3B1 mutations in 72 of
              354 patients (20\%) with myelodysplastic syndromes, with
              particularly high frequency among patients whose disease was
              characterized by ring sideroblasts (53 of 82 [65\%]). The gene
              was also mutated in 1 to 5\% of patients with a variety of other
              tumor types. The observed mutations were less deleterious than
              was expected on the basis of chance, suggesting that the mutated
              protein retains structural integrity with altered function. SF3B1
              mutations were associated with down-regulation of key gene
              networks, including core mitochondrial pathways. Clinically,
              patients with SF3B1 mutations had fewer cytopenias and longer
              event-free survival than patients without SF3B1 mutations.
              CONCLUSIONS: Mutations in SF3B1 implicate abnormalities of

              acute myeloid leukemia. Sequencing of MDS genomes has identified
              mutations in genes implicated in RNA splicing, DNA modification,
              chromatin regulation, and cell signaling. We sequenced 111 genes
              across 738 patients with MDS or closely related neoplasms
              (including chronic myelomonocytic leukemia and
              MDS-myeloproliferative neoplasms) to explore the role of acquired
              mutations in MDS biology and clinical phenotype. Seventy-eight
              percent of patients had 1 or more oncogenic mutations. We
              identify complex patterns of pairwise association between genes,
              indicative of epistatic interactions involving components of the
              spliceosome machinery and epigenetic modifiers. Coupled with
              inferences on subclonal mutations, these data suggest a
              hypothesis of genetic ``predestination,'' in which early driver
              mutations, typically affecting genes involved in RNA splicing,
              dictate future trajectories of disease evolution with distinct
              clinical phenotypes. Driver mutations had equivalent prognostic
              significance, whether clonal or subclonal, and leukemia-free
              survival deteriorated steadily as numbers of driver mutations
              increased. Thus, analysis of oncogenic mutations in large,
              well-characterized cohorts of patients illustrates the
              interconnections between the cancer genome and disease biology,

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Recent studies have provided a detailed census of
              genes that are mutated in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Our next
              challenge is to understand how this genetic diversity defines the
              pathophysiology of AML and informs clinical practice. METHODS: We
              enrolled a total of 1540 patients in three prospective trials of
              intensive therapy. Combining driver mutations in 111 cancer genes
              with cytogenetic and clinical data, we defined AML genomic
              subgroups and their relevance to clinical outcomes. RESULTS: We
              identified 5234 driver mutations across 76 genes or genomic
              regions, with 2 or more drivers identified in 86\% of the
              patients. Patterns of co-mutation compartmentalized the cohort
              into 11 classes, each with distinct diagnostic features and
              clinical outcomes. In addition to currently defined AML
              subgroups, three heterogeneous genomic categories emerged: AML
              with mutations in genes encoding chromatin, RNA-splicing
              regulators, or both (in 18\% of patients); AML with TP53
              mutations, chromosomal aneuploidies, or both (in 13\%); and,
              provisionally, AML with IDH2(R172) mutations (in 1\%). Patients
              with chromatin-spliceosome and TP53-aneuploidy AML had poor
              outcomes, with the various class-defining mutations contributing
              independently and additively to the outcome. In addition to
              class-defining lesions, other co-occurring driver mutations also
              had a substantial effect on overall survival. The prognostic
              effects of individual mutations were often significantly altered
              by the presence or absence of other driver mutations. Such
              gene-gene interactions were especially pronounced for
              NPM1-mutated AML, in which patterns of co-mutation identified
              groups with a favorable or adverse prognosis. These predictions
              require validation in prospective clinical trials. CONCLUSIONS:
              The driver landscape in AML reveals distinct molecular subgroups
              that reflect discrete paths in the evolution of AML, informing
              disease classification and prognostic stratification. (Funded by

              differentiation, and disappearance are critical to understanding
              both steady-state homeostasis and inflammatory responses. Here,
              using human in vivo deuterium labeling, we demonstrate that
              classical monocytes emerge first from marrow, after a postmitotic
              interval of 1.6 d, and circulate for a day. Subsequent labeling
              of intermediate and nonclassical monocytes is consistent with a
              model of sequential transition. Intermediate and nonclassical
              monocytes have longer circulating lifespans (∼4 and ∼7 d,
              respectively). In a human experimental endotoxemia model, a
              transient but profound monocytopenia was observed; restoration of
              circulating monocytes was achieved by the early release of
              classical monocytes from bone marrow. The sequence of
              repopulation recapitulated the order of maturation in healthy
              homeostasis. This developmental relationship between monocyte
              subsets was verified by fate mapping grafted human classical
              monocytes into humanized mice, which were able to differentiate
              sequentially into intermediate and nonclassical cells.},

               sequencing (NGS) to detect MRD in AML remains unproven. We
               analysed the clinical significance of monitoring MRD using
               ultradeep NGS (NGS-MRD) and flow cytometry (FCM-MRD) in 137
               samples obtained from 83 patients of NPM1mut AML at the end of

              myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) with ring sideroblasts (RS) but
              lack prognostic relevance. SRSF2 mutations are associated with
              shortened overall (OS) and leukemia-free survival (LFS) in both
              MDS and myelofibrosis. In this study of 226 patients with chronic
              myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), mutational frequencies were 40\%
              for SRSF2 (all affecting P95), 6\% for SF3B1 (primarily K700E)
              and 9\% for U2AF35 (mostly S34F and Q157P/R). These mutations
              were mutually exclusive and 54\% of the patients displayed at

              they can be used to estimate how many driver mutations are missed

              affected by canonical somatic mutations in aggressive type of

              837 exons between the cases with U2AF1 mutations (n = 6) and wild

              patterns in 35 genes comparing cells with mutant and wild-type
              U2AF1. U2AF1 mutations are associated with abnormal splicing of

              cycle progression and RNA processing. In addition, many of these

              NLRP3 assembles a multimeric inflammasome complex comprising the

              the NF-$\kappa$B pathway, the posttranscriptional molecular
              mechanism controlling the activation of NLRP3 remains elusive.
              Using both pharmacological and molecular approaches, we show that
              the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome is regulated by a

              elucidate a new role for CTCF in gene regulation during blood
              cell development. We identified dynamic, cell-type-specific
              binding sites for CTCF that colocalize with lineage-specific
              transcription factors. These dynamic sites are enriched for
              single-nucleotide polymorphisms that are associated with blood
              cell traits in different linages, and they coincide with the key
              regulatory elements governing hematopoiesis. CRISPR-Cas9-based
              perturbation experiments demonstrated that these dynamic

              U2AF1 are the most frequent class of mutations in myelodysplastic
              syndromes and are also common in clonal hematopoiesis, acute
              myeloid leukemia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and a variety of
              solid tumors. They cause genome-wide splicing alterations that
              affect important regulators of hematopoiesis. Several mRNA
              isoforms promoted by the various splicing factor mutants comprise
              a premature termination codon (PTC) and are therefore potential
              targets of nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD). In light of the
              mechanistic relationship between splicing and NMD, we sought
              evidence for a specific role of mutant SRSF2 in NMD. We show that
              SRSF2 Pro95 hot spot mutations elicit enhanced mRNA decay, which
              is dependent on sequence-specific RNA binding and splicing. SRSF2
              mutants enhance the deposition of exon junction complexes (EJCs)
              downstream from the PTC through RNA-mediated molecular
              interactions. This architecture then favors the association of
              key NMD factors to elicit mRNA decay. Gene-specific blocking of

              they affect not the fitness of an individual but the fitness
              distribution of its offspring. Some of the best-studied examples
              of indirect selection include alleles that modify aspects of the

              genes. RNA and protein levels of the DNA methyltransferase DNMT1
              have been shown to be elevated in tumors, however murine stem
              cells lacking Dnmt1 are still able to de novo methylate viral
              DNA. The recent cloning of a new family of DNA methyltransferases
              (Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b) in mouse which methylate hemimethylated and
              unmethylated templates with equal efficiencies make them
              candidates for the long sought de novo methyltransferases. We
              have investigated the expression of human DNMT1, 3a and 3b and
              found widespread, coordinate expression of all three transcripts
              in most normal tissues. Chromosomal mapping placed DNMT3a on
              chromosome 2p23 and DNMT3b on chromosome 20q11.2. Significant
              overexpression of DNMT3b was seen in tumors while DNMT1 and
              DNMT3a were only modestly over-expressed and with lower
              frequency. Lastly, several novel alternatively spliced forms of
              DNMT3b, which may have altered enzymatic activity, were found to
              be expressed in a tissue-specific manner.},

              with complex karyotype (CK-AML), we performed integrative
              analysis using TP53 mutational screening and array-based genomic
              profiling in 234 CK-AMLs. TP53 mutations were found in 141 of 234
              (60\%) and TP53 losses were identified in 94 of 234 (40\%)
              CK-AMLs; in total, 164 of 234 (70\%) cases had TP53 alterations.
              TP53-altered CK-AML were characterized by a higher degree of
              genomic complexity (aberrations per case, 14.30 vs 6.16; P <
              .0001) and by a higher frequency of specific copy number

              and +11/+11q/amp11q13∼25; among CK-AMLs, TP53-altered more
              frequently exhibited a monosomal karyotype (MK). Patients with

              alterations, white blood cell counts, and age were the only
              significant factors. In conclusion, TP53 is the most frequently

              with older age, genomic complexity, specific DNA copy number

              TP53 alteration is the most important prognostic factor in

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential
              (CHIP), which is defined as the presence of an expanded somatic
              blood-cell clone in persons without other hematologic
              abnormalities, is common among older persons and is associated
              with an increased risk of hematologic cancer. We previously found
              preliminary evidence for an association between CHIP and
              atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, but the nature of this
              association was unclear. METHODS We used whole-exome sequencing
              to detect the presence of CHIP in peripheral-blood cells and
              associated such presence with coronary heart disease using
              samples from four case-control studies that together enrolled
              4726 participants with coronary heart disease and 3529 controls.
              To assess causality, we perturbed the function of Tet2, the
              second most commonly mutated gene linked to clonal hematopoiesis,
              in the hematopoietic cells of atherosclerosis-prone mice. RESULTS
              In nested case-control analyses from two prospective cohorts,
              carriers of CHIP had a risk of coronary heart disease that was
              1.9 times as great as in noncarriers (95\% confidence interval
              [CI], 1.4 to 2.7). In two retrospective case-control cohorts for
              the evaluation of early-onset myocardial infarction, participants
              with CHIP had a risk of myocardial infarction that was 4.0 times
              as great as in noncarriers (95\% CI, 2.4 to 6.7). Mutations in
              DNMT3A, TET2, ASXL1, and JAK2 were each individually associated
              with coronary heart disease. CHIP carriers with these mutations
              also had increased coronary-artery calcification, a marker of
              coronary atherosclerosis burden. Hypercholesterolemia-prone mice
              that were engrafted with bone marrow obtained from homozygous or
              heterozygous Tet2 knockout mice had larger atherosclerotic
              lesions in the aortic root and aorta than did mice that had
              received control bone marrow. Analyses of macrophages from Tet2
              knockout mice showed elevated expression of several chemokine and
              cytokine genes that contribute to atherosclerosis. CONCLUSIONS
              The presence of CHIP in peripheral-blood cells was associated
              with nearly a doubling in the risk of coronary heart disease in
              humans and with accelerated atherosclerosis in mice. (Funded by

  abstract = {Acquired uniparental disomy (aUPD) is a common feature of cancer
              genomes, leading to loss of heterozygosity. aUPD is associated
              not only with loss-of-function mutations of tumour suppressor
              genes, but also with gain-of-function mutations of
              proto-oncogenes. Here we show unique gain-of-function mutations
              of the C-CBL (also known as CBL) tumour suppressor that are
              tightly associated with aUPD of the 11q arm in myeloid neoplasms
              showing myeloproliferative features. The C-CBL proto-oncogene, a
              cellular homologue of v-Cbl, encodes an E3 ubiquitin ligase and
              negatively regulates signal transduction of tyrosine kinases.
              Homozygous C-CBL mutations were found in most 11q-aUPD-positive
              myeloid malignancies. Although the C-CBL mutations were oncogenic
              in NIH3T3 cells, c-Cbl was shown to functionally and genetically
              act as a tumour suppressor. C-CBL mutants did not have E3
              ubiquitin ligase activity, but inhibited that of wild-type C-CBL
              and CBL-B (also known as CBLB), leading to prolonged activation
              of tyrosine kinases after cytokine stimulation. c-Cbl(-/-)
              haematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) showed enhanced
              sensitivity to a variety of cytokines compared to c-Cbl(+/+)
              HSPCs, and transduction of C-CBL mutants into c-Cbl(-/-) HSPCs
              further augmented their sensitivities to a broader spectrum of
              cytokines, including stem-cell factor (SCF, also known as KITLG),
              thrombopoietin (TPO, also known as THPO), IL3 and FLT3 ligand
              (FLT3LG), indicating the presence of a gain-of-function that
              could not be attributed to a simple loss-of-function. The
              gain-of-function effects of C-CBL mutants on cytokine sensitivity
              of HSPCs largely disappeared in a c-Cbl(+/+) background or by
              co-transduction of wild-type C-CBL, which suggests the pathogenic
              importance of loss of wild-type C-CBL alleles found in most cases
              of C-CBL-mutated myeloid neoplasms. Our findings provide a new
              insight into a role of gain-of-function mutations of a tumour
              suppressor associated with aUPD in the pathogenesis of some
              myeloid cancer subsets.},

              diagnosis, received intensive chemotherapy and achieved complete
              remission (CR) at Cleveland Clinic (CC). The Cancer Genome Atlas
              (TCGA) data were used for validation. In the CC cohort, median
              age was 58.5 years, 64\% had normal cytogenetics, and 31\%
              required >1 induction cycles to achieve CR1. In univariable
              analysis, patients carrying mutations in DNMT3A, U2AF1, and EZH2
              had worse overall and relapse-free survival. After adjusting for
              other variables, the presence of these mutations maintained an
              independent effect on survival in both CC and TCGA cohorts.
              Patients who did not have the mutations and underwent
              hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) had the best outcomes. HCT
              improved outcomes for patients who had these mutations. RUNX1 or
              ASXL1 mutations did not predict survival, and performance of HCT
              did not confer a significant survival benefit. Our results
              provide evidence of clinical utility in considering mutation
              screening to stratify IR-AML patients after CR1 to guide
              therapeutic decisions.},

              The view that T cells branch off from a lymphoid-restricted
              pathway has recently been challenged by a model proposing a
              common progenitor for T cell and myeloid lineages. We generated
              interleukin-7 receptor alpha (Il7r) Cre recombinase knockin mice
              and traced lymphocyte development by visualizing the history of
              Il7r expression. Il7r fate mapping labeled all T cells but few
              myeloid cells. More than 85\% of T cell progenitors were Il7r
              reporter(+) and, hence, had arisen from an Il7r-expressing
              pathway. In contrast, the overwhelming majority of myeloid cells
              in the thymus were derived from Il7r reporter(-) cells. Thus,
              lymphoid-restricted progenitors are the major route to T cells,
              and distinct origins of lymphoid and myeloid lineages represent a
              fundamental hallmark of hematopoiesis.},

  abstract  = {Abstract Abstract 962 Mutations in exons 8 and 9 of the CBL gene
               containing the RING and linker domains were recently described
               in 10 \% of CMML , 8\% of atypical CML and single cases of PMF
               or HES (Grand et al., Blood 2009). However, the number of cases
               is still limited and further biological characterization scarce.
               We therefore performed CBL mutation analysis in a large cohort
               of well characterized myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN). This
               cohort was selected according to the availability of
               cytomorphology, cytogenetics and further molecular genetic
               characterization. In total, 418 MPN patients were analysed. The
               cohort was composed of 182 males and 236 females with a median
               age of 68.3 years (range 16.3-93.3). Diagnoses according to
               cytomorphology were as follows: ET (n=88), PMF (n=33), PV
               (n=59), HES (n=14), CMML-1 (n=73), CMML-2 (n=26), MDS/MPN
               overlap (n=8), RARS-T (n=18), MPN unclassifiable (MPNu) (n=99).
               Cytogenetics was available in 382/418 cases (91.4\%) and
               revealed a normal karyotype in 312 cases (81.7\%) whereas 70
               (18.3\%) had chromosomal aberrations. A BCR-ABL rearrangement
               was excluded in all cases. Further molecular characterization
               revealed a JAK2V617F-mutation in 120/391 (30.7\%), diverse
               JAK2exon12 mutations in 7/37 (18.9\%) (all these cases were
               JAK2V617F unmutated PV), a MPLW515 mutation in 12/160 (7.5\%),
               and TET2 mutations in 26/110 (23.6\%) cases. Within the total
               cohort, CBL mutations were detected in 26/418 cases (6.2\%). As
               recently described, all mutations were missense mutations and
               were clustered in a region spanning 50 amino acids around the
               RING and linker domains. Two of 28 mutations were detected in
               two cases each (C419Y and A420G), all others were single and as
               follows (L380P, L381G, L381P, I383M, C384T, I384T, D388G, D390V,
               C396Y, G397V, H398A, C404Y, W408C, C416R, G415S, C416S, C416Y,
               P417H, R420L, R421L, I423N, I429F, I429N, V430M) (according to
               ENST00000264033). In 12 /26 cases the detection of the CBL
               wildtype (wt) only indicated allelic loss, and two patients had
               two different mutations. The mutations were most frequently
               found in CMML-1 (14/73; 19.2\%), CMML-2 (2/26; 7.9\%), PMF
               (4/32; 12.5\%) and MPN unclassifiable (7/99; 7.1\%). In
               contrast, CBL mutations were not detected in PV, ET, HES, RARS-T
               and MDS/MPN overlap. The presence of CBL mutations was not
               correlated to age, gender, chromosomal aberrations or WBC in
               comparison to CBL unmutated cases within the respective
               subcohorts. In addition, all 26 CBL mutated cases were analysed
               for JAK2V617F, JAK2exon12, MPLW515, FLT3-ITD, MLL-PTD, NPM1,
               NRAS and RUNX1 mutations. TET2 sequence analysis was available
               in two cases. The CBL mutations were exclusive of all these
               mutations with the exception of RUNX1 and TET2. Four of 16 CMML
               cases (25\%) with CBL mutations had a RUNX1 mutation and one
               MPNu case revealed a TET2 mutation. In CMML-1 11/14 (78.6\%)
               cases showed loss of the wt allele or two different mutations
               and thus lack a functionally intact CBL allele. In contrast,
               nearly all CBL mutations in MPNu and all PMF had a low allelic
               burden. From four of the CBL mutated cases also a sample at an
               earlier time point (3 to 14 months) was available. In three
               cases the mutation was already present two to three months
               before when MPN was suspected but not diagnosed. One case
               clearly gained a D388G within 14 months between first appearance
               of leukocytosis and diagnosis of MPN which indicates that CBL
               mutation is a later event in this case. In conclusion, these
               data show that CBL mutations i) are highly correlated with CMML,
               ii) in CMML are associated with high allelic burden or two CBL
               mutations, iii) in CMML are frequently associated with RUNX1
               mutations, iv) are rarely found in PMF and MPNu and are rare or
               absent in all other MPN, v) seem to be mutually exclusive of
               other mutations typical for MPN such as JAK2 and MPLW515
               mutations. Thus patients with suspected MPN who lack other MPN
               typical mutations should be routinely screened for CBL
               mutations. Disclosures: Schnittger: MLL Munich Leukemia Lab:

  abstract  = {The mammalian blood system, containing more than 10 distinct
               mature cell types, stands on one specific cell type,
               hematopoietic stem cell (HSC). Within the system, only HSCs
               possess the ability of bothmultipotency and self-renewal.
               Multipotency is the ability to differentiate into all functional
               blood cells. Self-renewal is the ability to give rise to HSC
               itself without differentiation. Since mature blood cells (MBCs)
               are predominantly short-lived, HSCs continuously provide more
               differentiated progenitors while properly maintaining the HSC
               pool size throughout life by precisely balancing self-renewal
               and differentiation. Thus, understanding the mechanisms of
               self-renewal and differentiation of HSC has been a central
               issue. In this review, we focus on the hierarchical structure of
               the hematopoietic system, the current understanding of
               microenvironment and molecular cues regulating selfrenewal and
               differentiation of adult HSCs, and the currently emerging

              located within a 67 bp region of an IDH1-secreted alkaline

              activated by the expression of SREBP-1a in the cells and, to a
              lesser degree, by that of SREBP-2. A 5'-end truncation of 23 bp

  abstract = {In acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), the cell of origin, nature and
              biological consequences of initiating lesions, and order of
              subsequent mutations remain poorly understood, as AML is
              typically diagnosed without observation of a pre-leukaemic phase.
              Here, highly purified haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs),
              progenitor and mature cell fractions from the blood of AML
              patients were found to contain recurrent DNMT3A mutations
              (DNMT3A(mut)) at high allele frequency, but without coincident
              NPM1 mutations (NPM1c) present in AML blasts. DNMT3A(mut)-bearing
              HSCs showed a multilineage repopulation advantage over
              non-mutated HSCs in xenografts, establishing their identity as
              pre-leukaemic HSCs. Pre-leukaemic HSCs were found in remission
              samples, indicating that they survive chemotherapy. Therefore
              DNMT3A(mut) arises early in AML evolution, probably in HSCs,
              leading to a clonally expanded pool of pre-leukaemic HSCs from
              which AML evolves. Our findings provide a paradigm for the
              detection and treatment of pre-leukaemic clones before the
              acquisition of additional genetic lesions engenders greater
              therapeutic resistance.},

              leukemia (AML). The prognostic impact of mutant TP53 (TP53mut)
              variant allelic frequency (VAF) is not well established, nor is
              how this information might guide optimal frontline therapy. We
              retrospectively analyzed 202 patients with newly diagnosed
              TP53-mutated AML who underwent first-line therapy with either a
              cytarabine- or hypomethylating agent (HMA)-based regimen. By
              multivariate analysis, TP53mut VAF >40\% was independently
              associated with a significantly higher cumulative incidence of
              relapse (P = .003) and worse relapse-free survival (P = .001) and
              overall survival (OS; P = .003). The impact of TP53mut VAF on
              clinical outcomes was driven by patients treated with a
              cytarabine-based regimen (median OS, 4.7 vs 7.3 months for VAF
              >40\% vs $\leq$40\%; P = .006), whereas VAF did not significantly
              affect OS in patients treated with HMA. The addition of
              venetoclax to HMA did not significantly affect OS compared with
              HMA without venetoclax, both in the entire TP53-mutated
              population and in patients stratified by TP53mut VAF. Among
              patients with TP53mut VAF $\leq$40\%, OS was superior in those
              treated with higher-dose cytarabine, whereas OS was similarly
              poor for patients with TP53mut VAF >40\% regardless of therapy.
              The best long-term outcomes were observed in those with 1 TP53
              mutation with VAF $\leq$40\% who received a frontline
              cytarabine-based regimen (2-year OS, 38\% vs 6\% for all others;
              P < .001). In summary, TP53mut VAF provides important prognostic
              information that may be considered when selecting frontline
              therapy for patients with newly diagnosed TP53-mutated AML.},

  abstract = {Background: The erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and
              C-reactive protein (CRP) are two commonly used measures of
              inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). As current RA
              treatment guidelines strongly emphasize early and aggressive
              treatment aiming at fast remission, optimal measurement of
              inflammation becomes increasingly important. Dependencies with
              age, sex, and body mass index have been shown for both
              inflammatory markers, yet it remains unclear which inflammatory
              marker is affected least by these effects in patients with early
              RA. Methods: Baseline data from 589 patients from the DREAM
              registry were used for analyses. Associations between the
              inflammatory markers and age, sex, and BMI were evaluated first
              using univariate linear regression analyses. Next, it was tested
              whether these associations were independent of a patient's
              current disease activity as well as of each other using multiple
              linear regression analyses with backward elimination. The
              strengths of the associations were compared using standardized
              beta ($\beta$) coefficients. The multivariate analyses were
              repeated after 1 year. Results: At baseline, both the ESR and CRP
              were univariately associated with age, sex, and BMI, although the
              association with BMI disappeared in multivariate analyses. ESR
              and CRP levels significantly increased with age ($\beta$-ESR =
              0.017, p < 0.001 and $\beta$-CRP = 0.009, p = 0.006), independent
              of the number of tender and swollen joints, general health, and
              sex. For each decade of aging, ESR and CRP levels became 1.19 and
              1.09 times higher, respectively. Furthermore, women demonstrated
              average ESR levels that were 1.22 times higher than that of men
              ($\beta$ = 0.198, p = 0.007), whereas men had 1.20 times higher
              CRP levels ($\beta$ = -0.182, p = 0.048). Effects were strongest
              on the ESR. BMI became significantly associated with both
              inflammatory markers after 1 year, showing higher levels with
              increasing weight. Age continued to be significantly associated,
              whereas sex remained only associated with the ESR level.
              Conclusions: Age and sex are independently associated with the
              levels of both acute phase reactants in early RA, emphasizing the
              need to take these external factors into account when
              interpreting disease activity measures. BMI appears to become
              more relevant at later stages of the disease.},

              multiple disorders. Although the initial cause and the affected
              organs vary among the different eosinophilic disorders, there are
              only 2 major pathways that mediate eosinophilia: (1)
              cytokine-mediated increased differentiation and survival of
              eosinophils (extrinsic eosinophilic disorders), and (2)
              mutation-mediated clonal expansion of eosinophils (intrinsic
              eosinophilic disorders). Independent from the original trigger,
              the most common cause of eosinophilia is the increased generation
              of IL-5-producing T cells. In some cases, tumor cells are the
              source of eosinophil hematopoietins. The intrinsic eosinophilic
              disorders are characterized by mutations in pluripotent or
              multipotent hematopoietic stem cells leading to chronic myeloid
              leukemias with eosinophils as part of the clone. Here, we propose
              a new classification of eosinophilic disorders on the basis of
              these obvious pathogenic differences between the 2 groups of
              patients. We then discuss many known eosinophilic disorders,
              which can be further subdivided by differences in T-cell
              activation mechanisms, origin of the cytokine-producing tumor
              cell, or potency of the mutated stem cell. Interestingly, many
              subgroups of patients originally thought to have the idiopathic
              hypereosinophilic syndrome can be integrated in this
              classification.},

              oocytes. We show that these CGIs depend on DNMT3A and DNMT3L but
              are not distinct at the sequence level, including in CpG
              periodicity. They are preferentially located within active
              transcription units and are relatively depleted in H3K4me3,

               interest given their increased prevalence with age,
               predisposition to morbid cardiovascular complications, and
               amplified risk of overt hematologic malignancy. Pts are often
               stratified by normal peripheral blood counts into clonal
               hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP), or those with
               unexplained cytopenias as clonal cytopenias of undetermined
               significance (CCUS). However, less is known about pts with
               elevated counts and clonal hematopoiesis who do not fulfill WHO
               criteria for any myeloproliferative neoplasia (MPN). We
               leveraged Vanderbilt University Medical Center's unique biobank,
               BioVU, to identify the prevalence of JAK2V617Facross 48,000 pts
               to evaluate the clinical changes in progression from CH to overt
               myeloid disease. Methods:To develop a reference JAKV617Ftraining
               set, next generation sequencing via Illumina Trusight Myeloid
               Panel (NGS) was performed on BioVU samples (N=133) from pts with
               confirmed myeloproliferative malignancy. Of those pts, 78
               harbored JAK2V617Fwith a range of variant allele frequencies
               (VAF). Matched samples in this training set (N=133) were also
               analyzed via Infinium\textregistered{} Expanded Multi-Ethnic
               Genotyping Array (MEGAEX). SNP array JAK2V617Fvariant intensity
               was extracted (rs77375493; NM\_004972.3(JAK2): c.1849G>T
               (p.Val617Phe). A regression model was built using NGS VAF as a
               dependent variable and MEGAEX intensity data as independent
               variable (r2=0.9931).Based on this model, we imputed
               JAK2V617FVAF for all 48,000 pts in our cohort. Pts with
               JAK2V617Fwere subdivided into: clinically confirmed myeloid
               disease, or JAK2V617Fwithout a diagnosis of MPN. Upon review of
               the EMR, the latter group was further dived into: 1) probable
               undiagnosedMPN, 2) CHIP, 3) CCUS, or 4) CH with associated
               elevated peripheral blood counts (CHAPbc). Only lab values after
               the date of JAK2V617Fdetection were included. Confirmed
               malignancy was defined by WHO classification of disease. Pts
               with evidence of possible WHO classified PV or ET with Hgb
               >18.5g/dl in men, >16.5g/dl in women, or PLT count >450k/mcl
               regardless of gender were classified as probable undiagnosedMPN.
               CHIP was defined as JAK2V617Fwithout abnormal counts across a
               patient's EMR lifetime, except when confounding events, e.g.
               trauma surgery or overt iron deficiency anemia, incorrectly
               skewed values. CCUS was defined as JAK2V617Fin the presence of
               unexplained cytopenias; hemoglobin (Hgb) 10.7 regardless of
               gender, Hgb 18-18.5 g/dL in men or 16.0-16.5 g/dL in women with
               maximum Hgb no greater than 18.5g/dl in men and 16.5g/dl in
               women, or PLT count between 371-450k/mcl regardless of gender
               (and no values >450k/mcl)] as CHAPbc. Results:We identified 410
               of 48,000 pts who harbored JAK2V617F(0.85\% prevalence). Of
               those, 270/410 had clinically diagnosed hematologic malignancy
               including primary myelofibrosis (PMF) (79), ET (48), PV (43) and
               Ph-MPN NOS (29). MDS (29), AML (15), NHL (16), plasma cell
               dyscrasias (5), CML (3), other (3). There were 19/410 with
               insufficient clinical data to determine diagnosis. The remaining
               121/410 JAK2V617Fpts did not have a related diagnosis. Figure 1a
               demonstrates imputed VAF differences in JAK2V617Fbetween known
               MPN vs. CH (including undiagnosed MPN) by age (mean VAF 0.44 vs.
               0.17 respectively P Summary: We used an unbiased approach to
               identify the prevalence of JAK2V617Facross all pts at a single
               institution. In this cohort, hematologic malignancy and CH did
               stratify by imputed VAF. Further, within JAK2V617FCH, CHAPbc may
               be differentiated from CHIP by clinical phenotype and further
               investigation will be required to determine its impact on

  abstract = {to explore the mechanism of p53 isoforms' activity in RCC.
              Methods The specimens of tumours (T) and clinically normal
              tissues (N) adjacent to them were collected from 41 patients with
              RCC. mRNA expression levels of p53 isoforms were detected using
              RT-PCR followed by nested PCR. Protein expression levels were
              detected using immunohistochemisty and Western blotting with the
              anti-p53 antibodies DO-1 and DO-12. The data were analyzed with
              clinicopathological features by x2 test or Fisher's exact test.
              Results p53 mRNA was expressed in all tumours and matched
              clinically normal tissue adjacent to the tumour. All six isoforms
              could be detected in tumour and normal tissues, with the
              exception of the $\Delta$133p53$\beta$ isoform, which was not
              detected in the normal tissue. Of the six isoforms, p53$\beta$
              mRNA was significantly overexpressed in tumour samples (P
              <0.001), and correlated with tumour stage. Nested PCR results
              consistently indicated the presence of p53$\gamma$ (19T/22N),
              $\Delta$133p53 (33T/26N), $\Delta$133p53$\beta$ (2T/0N), and
              $\Delta$133p53$\gamma$ (13T/9N). Immunohistochemical analysis
              showed that p53 was expressed only in tumour tissues and
              correlated with tumour stage and grade. The results of Western
              blotting analysis were consistent with these findings.
              Conclusions Although all six isoforms are present in RCC, their
              function in tumour development or progression might be different.
              Our findings suggest that p53$\beta$ might play an important role
              in the formation of RCC and it might be used as a new predictor
              and therapeutic target for RCC....},

  author   = {Steensma, David P},
  abstract = {Clonally restricted hematopoiesis is a common aging-associated
              biological state that predisposes to subsequent development of a
              hematological malignancy or cardiovascular death. Clonal
              expansion driven by leukemia-associated somatic mutations, such
              as DNMT3A, ASXL1, or TET2, is best characterized, but
              oligoclonality can also emerge without recognized leukemia-driver
              mutations, perhaps as a result of stochastic neutral drift.
              Murine models provide compelling evidence that a major mechanism
              of increased cardiovascular mortality in the context of clonal
              hematopoiesis is accelerated atherogenesis driven by
              inflammasome-mediated endothelial injury, resulting from
              proinflammatory interactions between endothelium and macrophages
              derived from circulating clonal monocytes. Altered inflammation
              likely influences other biological processes as well. The rate of
              development of overt neoplasia in patients with clonal
              hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP), as currently
              defined, is 0.5\% to 1\% per year. Contributing factors to clonal
              progression other than acquisition of secondary mutations in
              hematopoietic cells (ie, stronger leukemia drivers) are
              incompletely understood. Disordered endogenous immunity in the
              context of increased proliferative pressure, short telomeres
              leading to chromosomal instability, an unhealthy marrow
              microenvironment that favors expansion of clonal stem cells and
              acquisition of new mutations while failing to support healthy
              hematopoiesis, and aging-associated changes in hematopoietic stem
              cells, including altered DNA damage response, an altered
              transcriptional program, and consequences of epigenetic
              alterations, are all potential contributors to clonal
              progression. Clinical management of patients with CHIP includes
              monitoring for hematological changes and reduction of modifiable
              cardiovascular risk factors; eventually, it will also likely
              include anti-inflammatory therapies and targeted approaches to
              prune emergent dangerous clones.},

               one of science's most vigorous arguments. Science has seen its
               fair share of punch-ups over the years, but one debate, in the
               field of biology, has become notorious for its intensity. Over
               the last twenty years, Richard Dawkins and Stephen Jay Gould
               have engaged in a savage battle over evolution, which continues
               to rage even after Gould's death in 2002. Kim Sterelny moves
               beyond caricature to expose the real differences between the
               conceptions of evolution of these two leading scientists. He
               shows that the conflict extends beyond evolution to their very
               beliefs in science itself; and, in Gould's case, to domains in
               which science plays no role at all.},

  abstract = {Thirty-five years of research on p53 gave rise to more than
              68,000 articles and reviews, but did not allow the uncovering of
              all the mysteries that this major tumor suppressor holds. How p53
              handles the different signals to decide the appropriate cell fate
              in response to a stress and its implication in tumorigenesis and
              cancer progression remains unclear. Nevertheless, the uncovering
              of p53 isoforms has opened new perspectives in the cancer
              research field. Indeed, the human TP53 gene encodes not only one
              but at least twelve p53 protein isoforms, which are produced in
              normal tissues through alternative initiation of translation,
              usage of alternative promoters, and alternative splicing. In
              recent years, it became obvious that the different p53 isoforms
              play an important role in regulating cell fate in response to
              different stresses in normal cells by differentially regulating
              gene expression. In cancer cells, abnormal expression of p53
              isoforms contributes actively to cancer formation and
              progression, regardless of TP53 mutation status. They can also be
              associated with response to treatment, depending on the cell
              context. The determination of p53 isoform expression and p53
              mutation status helps to define different subtypes within a
              particular cancer type, which would have different responses to
              treatment. Thus, the understanding of the regulation of p53
              isoform expression and their biological activities in relation to
              the cellular context would constitute an important step toward
              the improvement of the diagnostic, prognostic, and predictive
              values of p53 in cancer treatment. This review aims to summarize
              the involvement of p53 isoforms in cancer and to highlight novel

              proteins function in several aspects of cell growth control,
              including multiple different steps in gene expression, and they
              are also found mutated in a number of specific diseases. For
              example, all contain domains for binding nucleic acids and have
              been shown to function in both RNA polymerase II-mediated
              transcription and pre-mRNA splicing, possibly connecting these
              two processes. Chromosomal translocations in human sarcomas

              1,000-2,500 live births. It has been mapped to a 5-cM region
              (NS1) [corrected] on chromosome 12q24.1, and genetic
              heterogeneity has also been documented. Here we show that
              missense mutations in PTPN11 (MIM 176876)-a gene encoding the
              nonreceptor protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2, which contains
              two Src homology 2 (SH2) domains-cause Noonan syndrome and
              account for more than 50\% of the cases that we examined. All
              PTPN11 missense mutations cluster in interacting portions of the
              amino N-SH2 domain and the phosphotyrosine phosphatase domains,
              which are involved in switching the protein between its inactive
              and active conformations. An energetics-based structural analysis
              of two N-SH2 mutants indicates that in these mutants there may be
              a significant shift of the equilibrium favoring the active
              conformation. This implies that they are gain-of-function changes
              and that the pathogenesis of Noonan syndrome arises from
              excessive SHP-2 activity.},

              Haematopoietic clones with acquired mutations become common with
              advancing age and can lead to blood cancers1-10. Here we describe
              shared and population-specific patterns of genomic mutations and
              clonal selection in haematopoietic cells on the basis of 33,250
              autosomal mosaic chromosomal alterations that we detected in
              179,417 Japanese participants in the BioBank Japan cohort and
              compared with analogous data from the UK Biobank. In this
              long-lived Japanese population, mosaic chromosomal alterations
              were detected in more than 35.0\% (s.e.m., 1.4\%) of individuals
              older than 90 years, which suggests that such clones trend
              towards inevitability with advancing age. Japanese and European
              individuals exhibited key differences in the genomic locations of
              mutations in their respective haematopoietic clones; these
              differences predicted the relative rates of chronic lymphocytic
              leukaemia (which is more common among European individuals) and T
              cell leukaemia (which is more common among Japanese individuals)
              in these populations. Three different mutational precursors of
              chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (including trisomy 12, loss of
              chromosomes 13q and 13q, and copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity)
              were between two and six times less common among Japanese
              individuals, which suggests that the Japanese and European
              populations differ in selective pressures on clones long before
              the development of clinically apparent chronic lymphocytic
              leukaemia. Japanese and British populations also exhibited very
              different rates of clones that arose from B and T cell lineages,
              which predicted the relative rates of B and T cell cancers in
              these populations. We identified six previously undescribed loci
              at which inherited variants predispose to mosaic chromosomal
              alterations that duplicate or remove the inherited risk alleles,
              including large-effect rare variants at NBN, MRE11 and CTU2 (odds
              ratio, 28-91). We suggest that selective pressures on clones are
              modulated by factors that are specific to human populations.
              Further genomic characterization of clonal selection and cancer
              in populations from around the world is therefore warranted.},

              function requires its tyrosine kinase binding (TKB) domain for
              targeting RPTKs and RING finger domain to recruit E2
              ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes. It has therefore been proposed
              that oncogenic Cbl proteins act in a dominant-negative manner to
              block this c-Cbl activity. In testing this hypothesis, we found

               marrow (BM) for various laboratory studies if the former can
               serve as well as the latter. In patients with newly diagnosed
               acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and more than 30\% blasts in PB
               there is considerable concordance between PB and BM in results
               of flow cytometric and cyto-genetic analyses. 1 At present,
               however, information about mutations in the NPM1 gene and
               internal tandem duplications (ITD) in the FLT3 gene are assuming
               as much significance as cytogenetics in decisions about therapy.
               2,3 For example, patients with NPM1 mutations and no FLT3-ITD
               are felt to have such low relapse rates that allogeneic
               transplant is not justified, while the opposite applies in
               patients with FLT3-ITD. Patients with NPM1 mutations and/or
               FLT3-ITD often present with high white blood cell (WBC) and PB
               blast counts. 4 Here we investigate the concordance between PB
               and BM in detecting NPM1 mutations and FLT3-ITD. We reviewed
               1016 patients with newly diagnosed or relapsed/refractory AML
               treated at Seattle Cancer Care Alliance/University of
               Washington, USA, from January 2008 to December 2013. Newly
               diagnosed AML required 20\% or more blasts in blood or marrow
               while the criterion for relapsed AML was more than 5\% blasts in
               BM or PB unrelated to recovery of normal hematopoiesis. In 30 of
               these patients, samples for FLT3-ITD mutation analysis and in 18
               of these patients, samples for NPM1 determination were sent from
               BM and PB with at most three days separating the PB and BM
               samples. We compared the clinical characteristics of these
               patients, as well as the correlation for FLT3-ITD allelic ratio
               in both PB and BM using Spearman correlation analysis. The study
               was approved by the institutional review board (IRB) at the
               University of Washington and Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research
               Center. These data were also independently reviewed by a
               hematopathologist. The median WBC count was 13x10 9 /L (range
               0.170-117.47x10 9 /L) and median absolute blood blasts were
               1.535 (range 0-113.06x10 9 /L) in the 30 patients in whom
               FLT3-ITD mutation was performed in both PB and BM. Corresponding
               values were 21 (range 1.19-97x10 9 /L) and 5.2 (range 230-62x10
               9 /L) in the 18 patients in whom NPM1 mutation was performed in
               both PB and BM, respectively. There was complete concordance
               between PB and BM in detecting FLT3-ITD mutation: 8 had FLT3-ITD
               detected in both PB and BM while 22 had no mutation detected. In
               2 patients FLT3-ITD were detected in PB despite very low WBC
               counts (0.4x10 9 /L and 0.17x10 9 /L) and no circulating blasts
               on the smear differentials, with the finding confirmed by the
               presence of an FLT3-ITD in BM (Table 1). Allelic ratios were
               highly correlated in PB and BM with correlation coefficient 0.92
               (95\%CI: 0.82-0.96; P<0.0001). There was also complete
               concordance between PB and BM in the 18 patients in whom NPM1
               mutations were analyzed in both: 4 had mutations in both PB and
               BM and 14 were NPM1 wild type in both PB and BM. All of the
               patients with NPM1 mutations had elevated WBC counts and high
               percentage of circulating blasts. Next, we looked at the 227
               patients who had FLT3-ITD mutational status evaluated in the PB.
               These included the 30 patients described previously who had
               FLT3-ITD mutation performed in both PB and BM. Of these, 61
               patients were positive for FLT3-ITD and the rest were negative,
               and most of these patients had no corresponding BM study
               performed concurrently. While the median WBC and absolute blasts
               were 30.41x10 9 /L and 20.5x10 9 /L for the 61 patients who were
               FLT3-ITD positive, and the values were 8.4x10 9 /L and 1.9x10 9
               /L for patients who were negative. Out of these 61 patients, 13
               patients had absolute blast counts less than 2x10 9 /L (Table
               2). We also looked at the 152 patients who had NPM1 mutational
               status evaluated in the PB. These included the 18 patients
               described above. NPM1 mutation was detected in 37 of the 152
               patients. The median WBC and absolute blasts were 30x10 9 /L and
               26.9x10 9 /L for the 37 patients who were NPM1 positive, and the
               values were 18.6x10 9 /L and 6.5x10 9 /L for patients who were
               negative. Out of these 37 patients, 13 patients had absolute

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: There may be differences in hematological parameters
              between meat-eaters and vegetarians. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this
              study was to perform cross-sectional analyses of hematological
              parameters by diet group in a large cohort in the United Kingdom.
              METHODS: A complete blood count was carried out in all UK Biobank
              participants at recruitment (2006-2010). We examined hemoglobin,
              red and white blood cell counts, and platelet counts and volume
              in regular meat eaters (>3 times/wk of red/processed meat
              consumption, n = 212,831), low meat eaters (n = 213,092), poultry
              eaters (n = 4815), fish eaters (n = 10,042), vegetarians (n =
              6548), and vegans (n = 398) of white ethnicity and meat eaters (n
              = 3875) and vegetarians (n = 1362) of British Indian ethnicity.
              RESULTS: In both white and British Indian populations, compared
              with regular meat eaters (or meat eaters in Indians), the other
              diet groups had up to 3.7\% lower age-adjusted hemoglobin
              concentrations (difference not significant in white vegan women)
              and were generally more likely to have anemia (e.g., 8.7\% of
              regular meat eaters compared with 12.8\% of vegetarians in white
              premenopausal women; P < 0.05 after Bonferroni correction). In
              the white population, compared with regular meat eaters, all
              other diet groups had lower age- and sex-adjusted total white
              cells, neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, and eosinophils
              (P-heterogeneity < 0.001 for all), but basophil counts were
              similar across diet groups; in British Indians, there was no
              significant difference in any of the white blood cell counts by
              diet group. Compared with white regular meat eaters, the low meat
              eaters, poultry eaters, fish eaters, and vegans had significantly
              lower platelet counts and higher platelet volume, whereas
              vegetarians had higher counts and lower volume. Compared with
              British Indian meat eaters, vegetarians had higher platelet count
              and lower volume. CONCLUSIONS: In the UK Biobank, people with low
              or no red meat intake generally had lower hemoglobin
              concentrations and were slightly more likely to be anemic. The
              lower white blood cell counts observed in low and non-meat
              eaters, and differences in mean platelet counts and volume
              between diet groups, warrant further investigation. This

              to the bloodstream, and enter the lung upon exposure to airway
              inflammatory signals, including eotaxins. In inflamed tissues,
              eosinophils act as key mediators of terminal effector functions
              and innate immunity and in linking to adaptive immune responses.
              Transcription factors GATA-1, CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein, and
              PU.1 play instructive roles in eosinophil specification from
              multipotent stem cells through a network of cooperative and
              antagonistic interactions. Not surprisingly, the interplay of
              these transcription factors is instrumental in forming the
              regulatory circuit of expression of eosinophil-specific genes,
              encoding eosinophil major basic protein and neurotoxin, CC
              chemokine receptor 3 eotaxin receptor, and IL-5 receptor alpha.
              Interestingly, a common feature is that the critical cis-acting
              elements for these transcription factors are clustered in exon 1
              and intron 1 of these genes rather than their promoters.
              Elucidation of the mechanism of eosinophil development and
              activation may lead to selective elimination of eosinophils in
              animals and human subjects. Furthermore, availability of a range
              of genetically modified mice lacking or overproducing
              eosinophil-specific genes will facilitate evaluation of the roles
              of eosinophils in the pathogenesis of asthma. This review
              summarizes eosinophil biology, focusing on development and
              regulation of eosinophil-specific genes, with a heavy emphasis on
              the causative link between eosinophils and pathological
              development of asthma using genetically modified mice as models

  abstract = {The development of leukemia is a step-wise process that is
              associated with molecular diversification and clonal selection of
              neoplastic stem cells. Depending on the number and combinations
              of lesions, one or more sub-clones expand/s after a variable
              latency period. Initial stages may develop early in life or later
              in adulthood and include premalignant (indolent) stages and the
              malignant phase, defined by an acute leukemia. We recently
              proposed a cancer model in which the earliest somatic lesions are
              often age-related early mutations detectable in apparently
              healthy individuals and where additional oncogenic mutations will
              lead to the development of an overt neoplasm that is usually a
              preleukemic condition such as a myelodysplastic syndrome. These
              neoplasms may or may not transform to overt acute leukemia over
              time. Thus, depending on the type and number of somatic
              mutations, clonal hematopoiesis (CH) can be divided into CH with
              indeterminate potential (CHIP) and CH with oncogenic potential
              (CHOP). Whereas CHIP mutations per se usually create the
              molecular background of a neoplastic process, CHOP mutations are
              disease-related or even disease-specific lesions that trigger
              differentiation and/or proliferation of neoplastic cells. Over
              time, the acquisition of additional oncogenic events converts
              preleukemic neoplasms into secondary acute myeloid leukemia
              (sAML). In the present article, recent developments in the field
              are discussed with a focus on CHOP mutations that lead to
              distinct myeloid neoplasms, their role in disease evolution, and
              the impact of additional lesions that can drive a preleukemic
              neoplasm into sAML.},

              are thought to originate when a driver mutation is acquired by a
              hematopoietic stem cell (HSC). However, when the mutation first
              occurs in individuals and how it affects the behavior of HSCs in

              at age 19 $\pm$ 3 years in a 63-year-old individual-and found
              that mutant HSCs have a selective advantage in both individuals.

              recent insights into the causes of malignancies, including

              cases, these form the basis of thrombo-hemorrhagic complications
              regularly observed in patient groups. This has led to the concept

              DNA from bone marrow and paired normal cells from 150 patients

              leukemia, a common and clinically heterogeneous leukemia
              occurring in adults, remains poorly understood. METHODS: We
              obtained DNA samples from leukemia cells in 91 patients with
              chronic lymphocytic leukemia and performed massively parallel
              sequencing of 88 whole exomes and whole genomes, together with
              sequencing of matched germline DNA, to characterize the spectrum
              of somatic mutations in this disease. RESULTS: Nine genes that
              are mutated at significant frequencies were identified, including
              four with established roles in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (TP53
              in 15\% of patients, ATM in 9\%, MYD88 in 10\%, and NOTCH1 in
              4\%) and five with unestablished roles (SF3B1, ZMYM3, MAPK1,
              FBXW7, and DDX3X). SF3B1, which functions at the catalytic core
              of the spliceosome, was the second most frequently mutated gene
              (with mutations occurring in 15\% of patients). SF3B1 mutations
              occurred primarily in tumors with deletions in chromosome 11q,
              which are associated with a poor prognosis in patients with

  abstract = {CTCF is a ubiquitously expressed regulator of fundamental genomic
              processes including transcription, intra- and interchromosomal
              interactions, and chromatin structure. Because of its critical
              role in genome function, CTCF binding patterns have long been
              assumed to be largely invariant across different cellular
              environments. Here we analyze genome-wide occupancy patterns of
              CTCF by ChIP-seq in 19 diverse human cell types, including normal
              primary cells and immortal lines. We observed highly reproducible
              yet surprisingly plastic genomic binding landscapes, indicative
              of strong cell-selective regulation of CTCF occupancy. Comparison
              with massively parallel bisulfite sequencing data indicates that
              41\% of variable CTCF binding is linked to differential DNA
              methylation, concentrated at two critical positions within the
              CTCF recognition sequence. Unexpectedly, CTCF binding patterns
              were markedly different in normal versus immortal cells, with the
              latter showing widespread disruption of CTCF binding associated
              with increased methylation. Strikingly, this disruption is
              accompanied by up-regulation of CTCF expression, with the result
              that both normal and immortal cells maintain the same average
              number of CTCF occupancy sites genome-wide. These results reveal
              a tight linkage between DNA methylation and the global occupancy
              patterns of a major sequence-specific regulatory factor.},

               blood-derived somatic mutations in KRAS, NRAS and BRAF. Our aim
               is to identify the prevalence of CH-derived mutations in these
               three genes in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) patients and
               reveal the practical clinical implication of these mutations on
               plasma cell-free DNA (cfDNA) genotyping. Methods We analyzed
               KRAS, NRAS and BRAF genotypes in plasma and matched tumor
               tissues of 236 mCRC patients through next-generation sequencing
               (NGS). Suspected CH mutations were defined as those only present
               in plasma with variant allelic frequencies (AFs) Results We
               identified suspected CH mutations in twenty patients (8.4\%,
               20/236). Three of these patients (1.27\%, 3/236) had a
               CH-derived KRAS mutation. Two of them had a KRAS G12X and the
               third had a KRAS Q61H. We did not detect CH-derived NRAS or BRAF
               mutations. Patients harboring a CH-derived mutation previously
               received chemotherapy treatment. In one CH-derived KRAS G12X
               case, the mutation was enriched in lymphocytes and persisted in
               cfDNA over the course of 4 months of therapy. Conclusions We
               confirmed the existence of CH-derived KRAS mutations in a small
               proportion of mCRC patients. This should be noted to prevent
               misclassification as tumor somatic mutations when performing

              the phylogeny of haematopoiesis, from embryogenesis to clinical

              are blood cancers more common in older age. JAK2V617F, the
              pathognomonic mutation in these cancers, was acquired in utero or
              childhood, with upper estimates of age of acquisition ranging
              between 4.1 months and 11.4 years across 5 patients. DNMT3A
              mutations, which are associated with age-related clonal
              haematopoiesis, were also acquired in utero or childhood, by 7.9
              weeks of gestation to 7.8 years across 4 patients. Subsequent
              driver mutation acquisition was separated by decades. The mean
              latency between JAK2V617F acquisition and clinical presentation
              was 31 years (range 12-54 years). Rates of clonal expansion
              varied substantially (200\% expansion/year), were affected by
              additional driver mutations, and predicted latency to clinical
              presentation. Driver mutations and rates of expansion would have
              been detectable in blood one to four decades before clinical
              presentation. This study reveals how driver mutation acquisition

  abstract = {Therapy-related acute myeloid leukaemia (t-AML) and
              therapy-related myelodysplastic syndrome (t-MDS) are
              well-recognized complications of cytotoxic chemotherapy and/or
              radiotherapy. There are several features that distinguish t-AML
              from de novo AML, including a higher incidence of TP53 mutations,
              abnormalities of chromosomes 5 or 7, complex cytogenetics and a
              reduced response to chemotherapy. However, it is not clear how
              prior exposure to cytotoxic therapy influences leukaemogenesis.
              In particular, the mechanism by which TP53 mutations are
              selectively enriched in t-AML/t-MDS is unknown. Here, by
              sequencing the genomes of 22 patients with t-AML, we show that
              the total number of somatic single-nucleotide variants and the
              percentage of chemotherapy-related transversions are similar in
              t-AML and de novo AML, indicating that previous chemotherapy does
              not induce genome-wide DNA damage. We identified four cases of
              t-AML/t-MDS in which the exact TP53 mutation found at diagnosis
              was also present at low frequencies (0.003-0.7\%) in mobilized
              blood leukocytes or bone marrow 3-6 years before the development
              of t-AML/t-MDS, including two cases in which the relevant TP53
              mutation was detected before any chemotherapy. Moreover,
              functional TP53 mutations were identified in small populations of
              peripheral blood cells of healthy chemotherapy-naive elderly
              individuals. Finally, in mouse bone marrow chimaeras containing
              both wild-type and Tp53(+/-) haematopoietic stem/progenitor cells
              (HSPCs), the Tp53(+/-) HSPCs preferentially expanded after
              exposure to chemotherapy. These data suggest that cytotoxic
              therapy does not directly induce TP53 mutations. Rather, they
              support a model in which rare HSPCs carrying age-related TP53
              mutations are resistant to chemotherapy and expand preferentially
              after treatment. The early acquisition of TP53 mutations in the
              founding HSPC clone probably contributes to the frequent
              cytogenetic abnormalities and poor responses to chemotherapy that
              are typical of patients with t-AML/t-MDS.},

              promoters of a large cohort of transcriptionally permissive
              genes, many of which encode regulators of neurogenesis.
              Surprisingly, Dnmt3a-dependent nonproximal promoter methylation
              promotes expression of these neurogenic genes by functionally
              antagonizing Polycomb repression. Thus, nonpromoter DNA

               for those that express activator molecules for latent
               TGF-$\beta$. Nonmyelinating Schwann cells in BM proved
               responsible for activation. These glial cells ensheathed
               autonomic nerves, expressed HSC niche factor genes, and were in
               contact with a substantial proportion of HSCs. Autonomic nerve
               denervation reduced the number of these active

              Two of them bear CpG-rich promoters and the other a CpG-poor

              quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR). Furthermore,
              the PPM1D protein expression was analyzed by immunohistochemistry
              in 157 NSCLC samples. The relationship between PPM1D expression
              and clinicopathological features was analyzed by appropriate

              significantly correlated with tumor grade (P = 0.006), tumor size
              (P = 0.017), clinical stage (P = 0.001), and lymph node
              metastases (P = 0.002). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis revealed
              that high PPM1D expression correlated with poor prognosis of

              and granulomonocytic colonies revealed that U2AF1S34F induced a
              higher number of cassette exon splicing events in
              granulomonocytic cells than in erythroid cells. U2AF1S34F altered
              mRNA splicing of many transcripts that were expressed in both
              cell types in a lineage-specific manner. In hematopoietic
              progenitors, the introduction of isoform changes identified in
              the U2AF1S34F target genes H2AFY, encoding an H2A histone
              variant, and STRAP, encoding serine/threonine kinase
              receptor-associated protein, recapitulated phenotypes associated
              with U2AF1S34F expression in erythroid and granulomonocytic
              cells, suggesting a causal link. Furthermore, we showed that
              isoform modulation of H2AFY and STRAP rescues the erythroid
              differentiation defect in U2AF1S34F MDS cells, suggesting that
              splicing modulators could be used therapeutically. These data
              have critical implications for understanding MDS phenotypic
              heterogeneity and support the development of therapies targeting

  abstract = {Activating mutations in genes encoding G protein $\alpha$
              (G$\alpha$) subunits occur in 4-5\% of all human cancers, but
              oncogenic alterations in G$\beta$ subunits have not been defined.
              Here we demonstrate that recurrent mutations in the G$\beta$
              proteins GNB1 and GNB2 confer cytokine-independent growth and
              activate canonical G protein signaling. Multiple mutations in
              GNB1 affect the protein interface that binds G$\alpha$ subunits
              as well as downstream effectors and disrupt G$\alpha$
              interactions with the G$\beta$$\gamma$ dimer. Different mutations
              in G$\beta$ proteins clustered partly on the basis of lineage;
              for example, all 11 GNB1 K57 mutations were in myeloid neoplasms,
              and seven of eight GNB1 I80 mutations were in B cell neoplasms.
              Expression of patient-derived GNB1 variants in Cdkn2a-deficient
              mouse bone marrow followed by transplantation resulted in either
              myeloid or B cell malignancies. In vivo treatment with the dual
              PI3K-mTOR inhibitor BEZ235 suppressed GNB1-induced signaling and
              markedly increased survival. In several human tumors, mutations
              in the gene encoding GNB1 co-occurred with oncogenic kinase
              alterations, including the BCR-ABL fusion protein, the V617F
              substitution in JAK2 and the V600K substitution in BRAF.
              Coexpression of patient-derived GNB1 variants with these mutant
              kinases resulted in inhibitor resistance in each context. Thus,
              GNB1 and GNB2 alterations confer transformed and resistance
              phenotypes across a range of human tumors and may be targetable
              with inhibitors of G protein signaling.},

              genome of lung cancer cells are well-documented6-10, but
              equivalent data for normal bronchial cells are lacking. Here we
              sequenced whole genomes of 632 colonies derived from single
              bronchial epithelial cells across 16 subjects. Tobacco smoking
              was the major influence on mutational burden, typically adding
              from 1,000 to 10,000 mutations per cell; massively increasing the
              variance both within and between subjects; and generating several
              distinct mutational signatures of substitutions and of insertions
              and deletions. A population of cells in individuals with a
              history of smoking had mutational burdens that were equivalent to
              those expected for people who had never smoked: these cells had
              less damage from tobacco-specific mutational processes, were
              fourfold more frequent in ex-smokers than current smokers and had

              mutations and 0-6\% of cells had two or even three drivers. Thus,
              tobacco smoking increases mutational burden, cell-to-cell
              heterogeneity and driver mutations, but quitting promotes
              replenishment of the bronchial epithelium from mitotically

              of gene expression and mutations in genes regulating each of
              these processes are common in leukaemia1,2. Despite the frequent
              overlap of mutations affecting epigenetic regulation and splicing
              in leukaemia, how these processes influence one another to
              promote leukaemogenesis is not understood and, to our knowledge,
              there is no functional evidence that mutations in RNA splicing
              factors initiate leukaemia. Here, through analyses of
              transcriptomes from 982 patients with acute myeloid leukaemia, we
              identified frequent overlap of mutations in IDH2 and SRSF2 that
              together promote leukaemogenesis through coordinated effects on
              the epigenome and RNA splicing. Whereas mutations in either IDH2
              or SRSF2 imparted distinct splicing changes, co-expression of
              mutant IDH2 altered the splicing effects of mutant SRSF2 and
              resulted in more profound splicing changes than either mutation
              alone. Consistent with this, co-expression of mutant IDH2 and
              SRSF2 resulted in lethal myelodysplasia with proliferative
              features in vivo and enhanced self-renewal in a manner not
              observed with either mutation alone. IDH2 and SRSF2 double-mutant
              cells exhibited aberrant splicing and reduced expression of
              INTS3, a member of the integrator complex3, concordant with
              increased stalling of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII). Aberrant INTS3
              splicing contributed to leukaemogenesis in concert with mutant
              IDH2 and was dependent on mutant SRSF2 binding to cis elements in
              INTS3 mRNA and increased DNA methylation of INTS3. These data
              identify a pathogenic crosstalk between altered epigenetic state
              and splicing in a subset of leukaemias, provide functional
              evidence that mutations in splicing factors drive myeloid
              malignancy development, and identify spliceosomal changes as a
              mediator of IDH2-mutant leukaemogenesis.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: In patients with acquired aplastic anemia,
              destruction of hematopoietic cells by the immune system leads to
              pancytopenia. Patients have a response to immunosuppressive
              therapy, but myelodysplastic syndromes and acute myeloid leukemia
              develop in about 15\% of the patients, usually many months to
              years after the diagnosis of aplastic anemia. METHODS: We
              performed next-generation sequencing and array-based karyotyping
              using 668 blood samples obtained from 439 patients with aplastic
              anemia. We analyzed serial samples obtained from 82 patients.
              RESULTS: Somatic mutations in myeloid cancer candidate genes were
              present in one third of the patients, in a limited number of
              genes and at low initial variant allele frequency. Clonal
              hematopoiesis was detected in 47\% of the patients, most
              frequently as acquired mutations. The prevalence of the mutations
              increased with age, and mutations had an age-related signature.
              DNMT3A-mutated and ASXL1-mutated clones tended to increase in
              size over time; the size of BCOR- and BCORL1-mutated and
              PIGA-mutated clones decreased or remained stable. Mutations in
              PIGA and BCOR and BCORL1 correlated with a better response to
              immunosuppressive therapy and longer and a higher rate of overall
              and progression-free survival; mutations in a subgroup of genes
              that included DNMT3A and ASXL1 were associated with worse
              outcomes. However, clonal dynamics were highly variable and might
              not necessarily have predicted the response to therapy and
              long-term survival among individual patients. CONCLUSIONS: Clonal
              hematopoiesis was prevalent in aplastic anemia. Some mutations
              were related to clinical outcomes. A highly biased set of
              mutations is evidence of Darwinian selection in the failed bone
              marrow environment. The pattern of somatic clones in individual
              patients over time was variable and frequently unpredictable.

              pathways induced by growth factors and cytokines, is also
              involved in DNA damage-triggered signaling and cellular
              responses. We previously demonstrated that SHP-2 played an
              important role in DNA damage-induced apoptosis and G2/M cell
              cycle checkpoint. In the present studies, we have provided
              evidence that SHP-2 functions in DNA damage apoptosis and G2/M
              arrest in catalytically dependent and independent manners,
              respectively. Mutant embryonic fibroblasts with the Exon 3
              deletion mutation in SHP-2 showed decreased apoptosis and
              diminished G2/M arrest in response to cisplatin treatment. Wild
              type (WT), but not catalytically inactive mutant SHP-2 (SHP-2
              C459S), rescued the apoptotic response of the mutant cells.
              Interestingly, both WT and SHP-2 C459S efficiently restored the
              G2/M arrest response. Furthermore, inhibition of the catalytic
              activity of endogenous SHP-2 in WT cells by overexpression of
              SHP-2 C459S greatly decreased cell death but not G2/M arrest
              induced by cisplatin. Biochemical analyses revealed that
              activation of c-Abl kinase was decreased in SHP-2
              C459S-overexpressing cells. However, DNA damage-induced
              translocation of Cdc25C from the nucleus to the cytoplasm was
              fully restored in both WT and SHP-2 C459S ``rescued'' cells.
              Additionally, we demonstrated that the role of SHP-2 in DNA
              damage-induced cellular responses was independent of the tumor
              suppressor p53. Embryonic stem cells with the SHP-2 deletion
              mutation showed markedly decreased sensitivity to
              cisplatin-induced apoptosis, attributed to impaired induction of
              p73 but not p53. In agreement with these results, DNA
              damage-induced apoptosis and G2/M arrest were also decreased in
              SHP-2/p53 double mutant embryonic fibroblasts. Collectively,
              these studies have further defined the mechanisms by which SHP-2

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: PPM1D (WIP1) negatively regulates by
              dephosphorylation many proteins including p53 tumour suppressor.
              The truncating mutations (nonsense and frameshift) in exon 6 of
              PPM1D were found recently in blood cells of patients with breast,
              ovarian or colorectal cancer. These mutants code for
              gain-of-function PPM1D with retained phosphatase activity. Their
              significance in carcinogenesis is unknown. METHODS: The exon 6 of
              PPM1D was sequenced in blood DNA of 543 non-small-cell lung
              cancer patients (NSCLC). The functional significance of selected
              PPM1D alterations (Arg458X, Lys469Glu) was compared with the
              wild-type gene and examined by recombinant DNA techniques,
              immunoblotting and luciferase reporter assays. RESULTS: The
              frameshift mutations were found in five NSCLC patients (5/543;
              0.92\%), all of them had squamous cell carcinomas (5/328; 1.5\%).
              All patients with the mutations were exposed, before the blood
              collection, to the DNA damaging agents as a part of
              chemotherapeutic regimen. Functional tests demonstrated that
              truncating mutation Arg458X causes enhancement of
              dephosphorylation activity of PPM1D toward serine 15 of p53,
              whereas Lys469Glu version is equivalent to the wild-type. Neither
              version of PPM1D (wild-type, Arg458X, Lys469Glu) significantly
              modulated the ability of p53 to transactivate promoters of the
              examined p53-target genes (BAX and MDM2). CONCLUSIONS: The
              truncating mutations of PPM1D are present in blood DNA of NSCLC
              patients at frequency similar to percentage determined for
              ovarian cancer patients. Our findings raise a question if the
              detected lesions are a result of chemotherapy.},

              modifications such as 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) are
              catalysed by the ten eleven translocation (Tet) methylcytosine
              dioxygenase family members, and the roles of Tet proteins in
              regulating chromatin architecture and gene transcription
              independently of DNA methylation have been gradually uncovered.
              However, the regulation of immunity and inflammation by Tet
              proteins independent of their role in modulating DNA methylation
              remains largely unknown. Here we show that Tet2 selectively
              mediates active repression of interleukin-6 (IL-6) transcription
              during inflammation resolution in innate myeloid cells, including
              dendritic cells and macrophages. Loss of Tet2 resulted in the
              upregulation of several inflammatory mediators, including IL-6,
              at late phase during the response to lipopolysaccharide
              challenge. Tet2-deficient mice were more susceptible to endotoxin
              shock and dextran-sulfate-sodium-induced colitis, displaying a
              more severe inflammatory phenotype and increased IL-6 production

              I$\kappa$B$\zeta$ at initial and resolution phases of

              methylation and hydroxymethylation, Tet2 recruited Hdac2 and

              repression activity of Tet2 via histone deacetylation and for the

              protein that plays important roles in splicing of mRNA
              precursors. SRSF2 mutations are frequently found in patients with
              myelodysplastic syndromes and certain leukemias, but how these
              mutations affect SRSF2 function has only begun to be examined. We
              used clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats
              (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein-9 nuclease to introduce the
              P95H mutation to SRSF2 in K562 leukemia cells, generating an
              isogenic model so that splicing alterations can be attributed
              solely to mutant SRSF2. We found that SRSF2 (P95H) misregulates
              548 splicing events (<1\% of total). Of these events, 374
              involved the inclusion of cassette exons, and the inclusion was
              either increased (206) or decreased (168). We detected a specific
              motif (UCCA/UG) enriched in the more-included exons and a
              distinct motif (UGGA/UG) in the more-excluded exons. RNA gel
              shift assays showed that a mutant SRSF2 derivative bound more
              tightly than its wild-type counterpart to RNA sites containing
              UCCAG but bound less tightly to UGGAG sites. Thus in most cases
              the pattern of exon inclusion or exclusion correlated with
              stronger or weaker RNA binding, respectively. We further show
              that the P95H mutation does not affect other functions of SRSF2,
              i.e., protein-protein interactions with key splicing factors. Our
              results thus demonstrate that the P95H mutation positively or
              negatively alters the binding affinity of SRSF2 for cognate RNA
              sites in target transcripts, leading to misregulation of exon
              inclusion. Our findings shed light on the mechanism of the
              disease-associated SRSF2 mutation in splicing regulation and also

              effect of TET2 mRNA level on the prognosis of children with ALL
              so far. METHODS: In this study, TET2 expression of samples
              cryopreserved in the liquid nitrogen from January 1, 2007 through
              December 31, 2011 was retrospectively analyzed in 136 newly
              diagnosed ALL patients by real-time polymerase chain reaction

              by the median value of patients group and divided into TET2 low
              and TET2 high groups. RESULTS: A total of 136 childhood ALL
              patients demonstrated lower TET2 expression than control group (P
              = .038). TET2 mRNA expression levels were correlated with the

              showed that low TET2 expression in children with ALL was

              condition is known as clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate
              potential (CHIP). Despite the fact these mutant clones become
              readily detectable in the blood of elderly individuals (∼10\% of
              people over the age of 65), the overall rate of disease
              progression remains relatively low. Thus, in addition to genetic
              mutations, there are likely environmental factors that contribute
              to clonal evolution in people with CHIP. One environmental stress
              that increases with age is inflammation. Although chronic
              inflammation is detrimental to the long-term function of normal

              This analysis revealed that the inflammatory environment of

              PPM1D mutations. We also show a specific association between

              that MK ablation led to activation of quiescent HSCs and
              increased HSC proliferation. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis
              revealed that transforming growth factor $\beta$1 (encoded by
              Tgfb1) is expressed at higher levels in MKs as compared to other
              stromal niche cells. MK ablation led to reduced levels of
              biologically active TGF-$\beta$1 protein in the bone marrow and
              nuclear-localized phosphorylated SMAD2/3 (pSMAD2/3) in HSCs,
              suggesting that MKs maintain HSC quiescence through
              TGF-$\beta$--SMAD signaling8,9. Indeed, TGF-$\beta$1 injection
              into mice in which MKs had been ablated restored HSC quiescence,
              and conditional deletion of Tgfb1 in MKs increased HSC activation
              and proliferation. These data demonstrate that TGF-$\beta$1 is a
              dominant signal emanating from MKs that maintains HSC quiescence.
              However, under conditions of chemotherapeutic challenge, MK
              ablation resulted in a severe defect in HSC expansion. In
              response to stress, fibroblast growth factor 1 (FGF1) signaling
              from MKs transiently dominates over TGF-$\beta$ inhibitory
              signaling to stimulate HSC expansion10,11. Overall, these

  abstract  = {Studies of the identity and physiological function of
               mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) have been hampered by a lack of
               markers that permit both prospective identification and fate
               mapping in vivo. We found that Leptin Receptor (LepR) is a
               marker that highly enriches bone marrow MSCs. Approximately
               0.3\% of bone marrow cells were LepR+, 10\% of which were
               CFU-Fs, accounting for 94\% of bone marrow CFU-Fs. LepR+ cells
               formed bone, cartilage, and adipocytes in culture and upon
               transplantation in vivo. LepR + cells were Scf-GFP+,
               Cxcl12-DsRedhigh, and Nestin-GFPlow, markers which also highly
               enriched CFU-Fs, but negative for Nestin-CreER and NG2-CreER,
               markers which were unlikely to be found in CFU-Fs. Fate-mapping
               showed that LepR+ cells arose postnatally and gave rise to most
               bone and adipocytes formed in adult bone marrow, including bone
               regenerated after irradiation or fracture. LepR+ cells were
               quiescent, but they proliferated after injury. Therefore, LepR+
               cells are the major source of bone and adipocytes in adult bone
               marrow. \copyright{} 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

  abstract = {Clonal hematopoiesis (CH) arises when a substantial proportion of
              mature blood cells is derived from a single dominant
              hematopoietic stem cell lineage. Somatic mutations in candidate
              driver (CD) genes are thought to be responsible for at least some
              cases of CH. Using whole-genome sequencing of 11 262 Icelanders,
              we found 1403 cases of CH by using barcodes of mosaic somatic
              mutations in peripheral blood, whether or not they have a
              mutation in a CD gene. We find that CH is very common in the
              elderly, trending toward inevitability. We show that somatic
              mutations in TET2, DNMT3A, ASXL1, and PPM1D are associated with
              CH at high significance. However, known CD mutations were evident
              in only a fraction of CH cases. Nevertheless, the highly
              prevalent CH we detect associates with increased mortality rates,
              risk for hematological malignancy, smoking behavior, telomere
              length, Y-chromosome loss, and other phenotypic characteristics.
              Modeling suggests some CH cases could arise in the absence of CD
              mutations as a result of neutral drift acting on a small
              population of active hematopoietic stem cells. Finally, we find a
              germline deletion in intron 3 of the telomerase reverse
              transcriptase (TERT) gene that predisposes to CH (rs34002450; P =
              7.4 $\times$ 10-12; odds ratio, 1.37).},
